WebAssembly: neither web nor assembly (Haas et al. 2017)
What is Wasm? A universal compilation target
A virtual stack machine (source language agnostic)
A predictable performance model
Code format A Wasm program is a structured module
Designed for streaming compilation
The term language is
statically typedand block-structuredControl ow is structured (
i.e.all CFGs are reducible)
Wasm MVP 1.0 is tailored for C/C ++
https://webassembly.org        

The need for stack switching in Wasm
Non-local control is pervasive in programming languages Async/await (e.g. C
++
, C #
, Dart, JavaScript, Rust, Swift) Coroutines (e.g. C
++
, Kotlin, Python, Swift) Lightweight threads (e.g. Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Swift)
Generators and iterators (e.g. C
#
, Dart, Haskell, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python) First-class continuations (e.g. Haskell, Java, OCaml, Scheme)
The problem
How do I compile non-local control ow abstractions to Wasm?Solution
Ceremoniously transform my entire source programs (e.g. Asyncify, CPS)
Add each abstraction as a primitive to Wasm
Use
eect handlers as a unied modular basis for control in Wasm

Perspectives on eect handlers
Operational interpretation First-class resumable exceptions
Software engineering interpretation Composable monads builders (monads as a design pattern)
Functional programming interpretation Folds over computation trees
Mathematical interpretation Homomorphisms between free algebraic models 

Eect handlers are a proven technology
A modular and extensible basis Structured form of delimited control
Easy encoding of
your favourite abstraction via eect handlersTrivially compatible with typed representations

;; imports yield : [] -> []
(
func $yield ( import""co2"" ""yield""))...

Instructions: declaring control tags
Control tag declaration (tag $tag (param 
) ( result 
))
it's a mild extension of Wasm's exception tags
(known in the literature as an `operation symbol' (Plotkin and Pretnar 2013))

Instructions: creating continuations
Continuation type (cont $ft )
cont is a new reference type constructor parameterised by a function type, $ft : [

where $ft : [

Abstracts	: The  appearance  of  a  new  programming 	
language  gives  the  necessity  to  contrast  its  contribution 
with the existing programming languages to evaluate the 
novelties  and  improvements  that  the  new  programming 
language  offers  for  developers.  Intended  to  eventually	 	
replace Objective	-C  as Apple‚Äôs language  of choice, Swift 	
needs  to  convince  developers  to  switch  over  to  the  new 
language.  Apple  has  promised  that  Swift  will  be  faster 
than Objective	-C, as well as offer more modern language 	
features,  be  very  safe,  and  be  e	asy  to  learn  and  use.  In 	
this thesis developer  test  these  claims by creating an iOS 
application  entirely  in  Swift  as  well  as  benchmarking 
two  di	Ô¨Äerent  algorithms.  Developer  Ô¨Ånds  that  while 	
Swift  is  faster  than  Objective	-C,  it  does  not  see  the 	
speedup proje	cted by Apple. Swift was launched to offer 	
an  alternative  to  Objective	-C  because  this  has  a  syntax 	
which barely evolved from it was created and has a great 
difference  with  other  programming  languages  that  have 
appeared in the latest years, because these ha	ve based on 	
the  C++  syntax.  For  this,  Swift  is  inspired  in  new 
programming  languages  like  C++11,  C#,  F#,  Go, 
Haskell,  Java,  JavaScript,  Python,  Ruby.  Then  his 
syntax  is  totally  different  than  its  predecessor.  The 
Swift‚Äôs  syntax  is  more  simplified  because  i	t  does  not  use 	
pointers  and  includes  improvements  in  its  data 
structures and in its syntax.

I. 	INTRODUCTION	 	
In  the  summer  of  2008  Apple  launched  the  App  Store  for 
the  iPhone  and  iPod  touch.    Originally  containing  only  522 
apps,  as  of  2014  the  App  store  houses  over  1  million  apps 
and has seen over 75 billion app downloads.    This platform 
has  attracted  thousands  of	 developers  to  create  applications 	
for  iOS  devices,  and  has  launched  thousands  of  careers  and 
companies.    As    Objective	-C    aged    it    became    harder   	
for    new    developers,    unfamiliar with C and SmallTalk, to 
learn and understand.    Languages such as Java, P	ython, and 	
JavaScript  became  widely  used  and  began  to  set  the 
standard  for  modern  programming  languages.      Developers 
began to complain that Objective	-C  was di cult  to learn and 	
uncomfortable to use.   	 	
Swift  is  a  new  programming  language  for  iOS  and  OS  X 
apps  that  builds  on  the  best  of  C  and  Objective	-C,  without 	
the  constraints  of  C  compatibility.  Swift  adopts  safe 
programming  patterns  and  adds  modern  features  to  make 
programming  easier,  more  flexible,  and  more  fun.  Swift‚Äôs 
clean  slate,  backed  by  the  mature	 and  much  loved  Cocoa 	
and  Cocoa  Touch  frameworks,  is  an  opportunity  to 
reimaging how software development works.	 	
II. 	LITERATURE SURVEY	 	
By  Christ  Lattner(2015)	Released    in    June    of    2014    by   	
Apple    Swift    is    a    statically    typed    language  and   
compiled   	language    that    uses    the    LLVM    compiler   	
infrastructure    and  the  Objective	-C  runtime  .    Since  Swift 	
uses the same runtime as Objective	-C    the    two    languages   	
can    be    intermixed    in    a    single    program    or  project, 
as  both  will  compile  down  to  native  ma	chine  code.    Swift 	
can  access  Objective	-C  classes,  types,  functions,  and 	
variables  through  a  ""bridging  header"",  as  well  as  by 
extension  C  and  C++  code.    Similarly  Objective	-C  can 	
access  code  written  in  Swift,  with  some  exceptions.    This 
allows  Swift  to  wor	k  with  the  Cocoa  and  Cocoa  Touch 	
frameworks  and  existing  Objective	-C  apps  and  libraries 	
without rewriting the large body of code that was written for 
iOS  devices.  Swift  is  heavily  influenced  by  many  other 
languages such as Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, and 	C#, and 	
offers  many  of  the  object	-oriented  and  functional  features 	
found  in  these  languages.    Swift  also  includes  a 
read	-eval	-print	-loop  (REPL)  that  can  be  accessed  in  Xcode 	
as well as on the command line.	 	
 
Prof.  Diwakar  Gupta: 	Many  previous  researchers  ha	ve 	
proposed  methods  for  evaluating  and  com	-paring  new 	
programming  languages.    Languages  are  often  compared 
against  one  another  on  a  number  of  different  criteria.     
Developers  compared  C++,  Java,  Perl,  and  Lisp  together 
and their approach was extended to ev	en more languages by 	
other  developers.    Both  of  these    papers    conclude    that   
each    language    has    various    pros    and    cons    and  are 
suited  to  different  types  of  tasks,  with  Java  and  C  receiving 
the most favourable reviews.    Many programming language 
eval	uations  examine  a  language  holistically  and 	
qualitatively,  although  attempts  have  been  made  to  be  more

rigorous  and  quantitative.  Urban  propose  a  qualitative 
framework  for  assessing  languages  in  terms  of  twelve 
different  attributes  including  regularity,  re	adability, 	
reliability,  portability,  and  Input/output.      This    framework   
provides    a    standardized    way    to    evaluate    a   
language    in    isolation    and    describes    the    key   
attributes    important    in    any    language design.    Although 
these  frameworks  and  co	mparisons  help  unveil  the 	
important  aspects  of  a  programming  language,  they  are  too 
high  level  to  be  appropriately  applied  to  Swift.  Other 
researchers  have  looked  at  programming  languages  as  they 
apply  to  a  specific  domain.      Since    swift    is    meant    to   
be    used    primarily    for    mobile  devices,  this  type  of 
research  is  more  applicable.    Gupta  discusses  the 
appropriateness  of  programming  languages  for  teaching 
beginners  or  teaching,  ultimately  recommending  basic  or  C. 
Howatt  recommends  evaluating  a  language	 based  on  how 	
well  it  solves  a  given  project  or  task  on  hand  although  he 
has  doubts  about  the  real  world  relevance  of  this  approach. 
Oppermann  and  Compos  discuss  several  popular  languages 
used  for  mobile  clients  and  server	-side  development.    They 	
conclude 	that  using  single  language  on  both  the  mobile 	
client  and  server  offers  a  distinct  advantage  and  that  Java 
and  Python  are  the  best  choices  for  this  approach. 
Developers      use    design    patterns    to    evaluate    the    Go   
programming language .They implement a s	ubset of the Hot 	
Draw  framework  in  Go  and  use  their  implementation  to 
motivate  a  discussion  of  the  language  .    This  project  was 
the  main  source  of  inspiration  for  my  analysis  of  Swift, 
since  the  authors  used  a  large  project  to  demonstrate  their 
view  on  a  n	ew  language.    While  I  do  not  use  design 	
patterns  or  the  Hot  Draw  frame	-work  in  my  Swift 	
application.	 	
By  Apple‚Äôs  Developers  Team(2014)	Development  on  Swift 	
was  begun  in  July  2010  by	 Chris  Lattner,  with  the  eventual 	
collaboration  of  many  other  programmers  at	 Apple.  Swift 	
took  language  ideas 
""from	 Objective	-C,Rust,	 Haskell,	 Ruby,	 Python,	 C#,	 CLU, 	
and far too many others to list"".	 On June  2, 2014, the	 Apple 	
Worldwide  Developers  Conference	 (WWDC)  application 	
became  the  first  publicly  released  app  written  in 
Swif	t. A beta  version	 of  the	 programming  language	 was 	
released  to  registered  Apple  developers  at  the  conference, 
but  the  company  did  not  promise  that  the  final  version  of 
Swift  would  be	 source  code	 compatible  with  the  test 	
version.  Apple  planned  to  make  source	 code  converters 	
available if needed for the full release.	 	
The Swift Programming Language, a  free 500	-page  manual, 	
was  also  released  at  WWDC,  and  is  available  on 
the	 iBooks	 Store and the official website.	 	
Swift reached the  1.0 milestone  on September 9, 2014, with 
the	 Gold  Master	 of Xcode	 6.0  for	 iOS.Swift  1.1  was 	
released  on  October  22,  2014,  alongside  the  launch  of 
Xcode  6.1.	 Swift  1.2  was  released  on  April  8,  2015,  along 	
with  Xcode  6.3.	 Swift  2.0  was  anno	unced  at  WWDC  2015, 	
and was made available for publishing apps in the App Store 
in September 21, 2015.A Swift 3.0 roadmap was announced 
on  the  Swift  blog  on  December  3,  2015.	 However,  before 	
that,  an  intermediate  Swift  2.2	 embracing  new  syntax  and 	
features	 was  introduced.  This  also  omits  some  outdated 	
components including Tuple splat syntax, C	-style for loops.	 	
Swift  won  first  place  for	 Most  Loved  Programming 	
Language	 in  the	 Stack  Overflow	 Developer  Survey 	
2015	 and second place in 2016.	 	
Google  is  said  to  be  considering  using  swift  as  a  first  class 
language fo	r its operating system android.	 	During  the 	
wwd  2016,  apple  announced  an	 ipad  exclusive  app,  named 	
swift  playgrounds  that  will  easily  teach  people  how  to  code 
in swift. 	The	 app is presented in an interface which provides 	
feedback  when  lines  of  code  are  placed  in  a  certain  order 
and executed.	 	
III.	 	RESEARCH WORK	 	
Swift  needs  to  convince  develope	rs  to  switch  over  to  the 	
new  language.   	As	 it  assumed      that  swift  will  be  faster 	
than objective	-c, as well as swift is safe, and      easy to learn 	
and  use.   	In this  thesis  developers,  developing  an  ios 	
application  entirely  in  swift  as  well  as  benchmarking  t	wo 	
different  algorithms. 	As	 it's  mentioned  earlier  that  swift  is 	
faster  than  objective	-c  and  it  does  not  find  the  performance 	
projected  by	 DEVELOPERS	.  I ALSO  CONCLUDE  THAT 	SWIFT 	
HAS  MANY  ADVANTAGES 	OVER 	OBJECTIVE	-C, AND  IS  EASY 	
for  developers  to  learn  and  use.    However  there  are  some 
weak areas of Swift involving interactions with Objective	-C 	
and  the  strictn	ess  of  the  compiler  that  can  make  the 	
language  bit  difficult  to  work  with.      Apart  from  all  these 
drawbacks, Swift is overall a  successful software  generating 
language for us.	 	
The four stated goals of swift (safety, clarity, modernity, and 
performance)  reflect  both  an  accurate  analysis  of  the 
deficiencies  of  objective	-c  and  an  fair  assessment  of  the 	
various  developments  that  have  taken  place  ov	er  the  last 	
three  decades  in  programming  language  design	--mostly 	
object  oriented  languages  like  c++,  java,  python,  and  ruby, 
but  also  more  specialized  languages  such  as  the  functional 
language haskell.	 	
If  you  have  experience  using  Objective	-C  to  develop  for 	
Apple  platforms,  you  may  be  wondering:  ‚ÄúWhy  did  Apple 
release  a  new  language?‚Äù  After  all,  developers  had  been 
pro	ducing  high	-quality  apps  for  Mac  OS  X  and  iOS  for 	
years.  Apple  has  a  few  things  in  mind.  First,  Objective	-C  is 	
an older language. And while this is not always a problem, it 
leads  to  some  difficulty  in  this  case.  The  syntax  of 
Objective	-C  was  solidified  pri	or  to  the  rise  of  prominent 	
scripting  languages  in  the  1990s  that  popularized  more 
streamlined  and  elegant  syntax  (e.g.,  JavaScript,  Python, 
PHP,  Ruby,  and  others).  This  means  Objective	-C  feels 	
strange  to  most  developers  when  they  get  started,  so  its 
synta	x  can  be  an  impediment  to  developer  productivity. 	
Additionally,  as  an  older  language,  Objective	-C  is  missing

many  advancements  developers  in  modern  languages 
currently enjoy. Also, Swift aims to be safe. Objective	-C did 	
not  aim  to  be  unsafe,  but  things  hav	e  changed  quite  a  bit 	
since  Objective	-C  was  released  in  the  1980s.  For  example, 	
the  Swift  compiler  aims  to  minimize  undefined  behavior, 
which  is  intended  to  save  the  developer  time  debugging 
code  that  failed  during  the  runtime  of  an  application. 
Another go	al of Swift is to be a suitable replacement for the 	
C  family  of  languages  (C,  C++,  and  Objective	-C).  That 	
means  Swift  has  be  fast.  Indeed,  Swift's  performance  is 
comparable  to  these  languages  in  most  cases.  Swift  gives 
you  safety  and  performance  all  in  a  c	lean,  modern  syntax. 	
The  language  is quite expressive;  developers can  write  code 
that  feels  natural.  This  feature  makes  Swift  a  joy  to  write 
and  easy  to  read,  which  makes  it  great  for  collaborating  on 
larger projects.

‚Ä¢ Mac  mini  system  form  Apple  or  Other  Mac  CPU  with 
OSX installed.	‚Ä®	 	
 
3.4 	Methodology	 	
Swift  and  Objective	-C  compilers  are  based  on  the  LLVM 	
Compiler  Infrastructure,  and  there  is  a  single  iOS  SDK  for 
both  Swift  and  Objective	-C.  That's  why  there  isn‚Äô	t  much 	
difference  between  the  ways  the  programming  languages 
work with the Cocoa frameworks.	 	
We  decided  to  examine  both  Swift  and  Objective	-C 	
performance by comparing their data structures.  For that we 
took  Objective	-C  Foundation  framework  and  Swift‚Äôs  nati	ve 	
solutions. 	 	
In  Swift,  all  classes  are  created  during  compile	-time. 	
Methods cannot be added on	-the	-fly and all types are known 	
before  the  run  time.  Since  everything  is  known  beforehand, 
a compiler can optimize code without any problem.	 	
Objective	-C,  on  t	he  other  hand,  can‚Äôt  optimize  as 	
effectively, because all dynamic languages work slower than 
static.	 	
Swift drops the  two	-file requirement.  Xcode  and the  LLVM 	
compiler  can  figure  out  dependencies  and  perform 	
incremental  builds  automatically  in  Swift  1.2.  As	 a  result, 	
the repetitive task of separating the table of	 contents (header 	
file)  from  the  body  (implementation  file)  is  a  thing  of  the 
past.  Swift  combines  the  Objective	-C  header  (.h)  and 	
implementation files (.m) into a single code file (.swift).	 	
Objectiv	e-C‚Äôs  two	-file  system  imposes  additional  work  on 	
programmers 	-- and  its  work  that  distracts  programmers 	
from  the  bigger  picture.  In  Objective	-C  you  have  to 	
manually  synchronize  method  names  and  comments 
between  files,  hopefully  using  a  standard  convention,	 but 	
this  isn‚Äôt  guaranteed  unless  the  team  has  rules  and  code 
reviews in place.	 	
IV.	 	RESULT	 	
Test performed with an algorithm in each language to sort a 
list  of  1,000,000  objects  in  ascending  order.  The  objects 
were  sorted  in  order  based  on  a  randomly  generated 
numerical instance variable that ranged from ‚àí1000 to 1000. 
Since C does not support ob	jects a struct was used instead. I 	
ran  each  algorithm  25  times  and  plotted  the  results.  Swift 
and  Objective	-C  both  performed  approximately  equal, 	
running  on  average  1.4x  faster  than  Python.  However  both 
languages  paled  in  comparison  to  Java  and  C,  with  Jav	a 	
being on average twice as fast as either language.

V. 	CONCLUSION	 	
Swift's  level  of  raw  processing  performance  has  yet  to  be 
credibly  demonstrated.  But  there  is  good  reason  to  believe 
that  this  will  be  achieved,  with  Swift  performing  far  faster 
than  Python  and  Ruby,  at  least  modestly  faster  than 
Objective	-C,  and  even  slig	htly  faster  than  C  in  some 	
circumstances.	 	
Swift  is  not  yet  a  production  language  for  large	-scale 	
projects.  Small  and  perhaps  medium	-scale  apps  have  been 	
successfully  built  and  are  in  the  App  Store,  built  by 
developers  with  a  certain  persistence  and  willing	ness  to 	
work  around  problems.  The  compiler  is  slow,  with  delays 
apparently  exponentially  related  to  the  amount  of  code  and 
dependent  upon  which  files  and  modules  the  code  is 
packaged in. Error messages  are  not very informative, often 
at  an  extremely  low  le	vel.  Automatic  bridging  that  is 	
intended to make Swift work ""seamlessly"" with the iOS API 
doesn't  always  work.  As  discussed  earlier,  the  compiler 
often  produces  poorly  optimised  code,  including  code  with 
extraneous  retain	-release  statements.  The  Xcode  inte	ractive 	
development  environment  can  be  slow  to  respond  with 
autocompletion  and  with  flagging  errors  and  turning  error 
flags off when they have been fixed.	 	
The  reaction  to  Swift  from  the  developer  community  has 
generally been very positive. Criticism has be	en minor. This 	
is perhaps surprising given the programmer culture in which 
people  have  strong  and  often  crazy  opinions  about 
everything, no matter how ill	-informed.	 	
Some  of  the  negative  reactions  have  been  predictable: 
Enthusiasts  of  scripting  languages  li	ke  JavaScript  think  that 	
not  having  implicit  type  conversion  (automatically 
converting  a  data  value's  type  when  necessary)  makes  the 
language  too  inflexible.  This  is  mostly  a  philosophical 
disagreement  that  has  no  solution.  Some  programmers  feel 
that  error	s  are  inevitable  and  want  their  programs  to  run  no 	
matter  what.  Others  want  them  to  quickly  fail  in  hopes  of 
getting every	 LAST BUG OUT	. 	
O Some major projects that were started in Swift reverted to 
Objective	-C  when  compiler  and  other  issues  developed. 	
Most	 of  these  projects  are  looking  to  migrate  to  Swift  as 	
soon as they reasonably can.	 	
Some  programmers  will  not  be  so  quick  to  switch. 
Automatic  Reference  Counting  has  solved  the  most 
significant  annoyance  with  Objective	-C  (having  to  allocate 	
and deallocate m	emory manually) and its source of the most 	
critical  errors  (memory  leaks  when  memory  not  deallocated 
properly  and  crashes  when  deallocation  is  done 
unnecessarily).  Many  programmers  will  have  worked  with 
Objective	-C so long that they have adapted to its qui	rks, are 	
blind  to  its  confusing  aspects,  and  can  work  productively 
with it (although they surely spend a lot of time debugging.) 
There  are  other  programmers  who  like  doing  tricky  (and 
arguably unsafe) things with low level pointers. 	 	
Apple  is quick to depr	ecate  APIs that  it  no longer considers 	
those  it  wants  developers  to  use,  and  is  aggressive  about 
pushing  users  and  developers  to  the  latest  versions  of  iOS 
and  to  relatively  recent  hardware.  But  Apple  clearly  needs 
Objective	-C  to  maintain  the  legacy  APIs, 	and  parts  of  the 	
iOS  and  OS  X  operating  systems,  that  have  been  written  in 
it.  And  there  is  a  large  base  of  app  code  that  has  been 
written in Objective	-C.  Apple is  unlikely to be  very quickly 	
aggressive  about  getting  to  developers  to  switch  to  Swift. 
But  A	pple  has  made  it  easy  to  mix  Swift  and  Objective	-C 	
code.  It  is  quite  possible  that  Apple  will  slowly  nudge 
developers  in  the  direction  of  using  Swift,  without 
prohibiting  Objective	-C.  This  might  include  requiring  a√çpps 	
being  submitted  to  the  App  Store  to  b	e  have  their  root 	
controller  written  in  Swift  but  allow  calling  on  Objective	-C 	
code.  It  could  also  involve  developing  new  APIs  for  Swift 
that do not work in Objective	-C.

Chapter	1:	Introduction	
This	guide	provides	instructions	for	using	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	scan	code	on	
most	major	programming	platforms.	This	guide	is	intended	for	people	responsible	for	security	audits	
and	secure	coding.	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	17	
About	the	Analyzers	19	
Related	Documents	20	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	is	aset	of	software	security	analyzers	that	search	for	violations	of	security-	
specific	coding	rules	and	guidelines	in	avariety	of	languages.	The	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	language	
technology	provides	rich	data	that	enables	the	analyzers	to	pinpoint	and	prioritize	violations	so	that	
fixes	are	fast	and	accurate.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	produces	analysis	information	to	help	you	
deliver	more	secure	software,	as	well	as	make	security	code	reviews	more	efficient,	consistent,	and	
complete.	Its	design	enables	you	to	quickly	incorporate	new	third-	party	and	customer-	specific	security	
rules.
At	the	highest	level,	using	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	involves:	
1.	Running	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	as	astand-	alone	process	or	integrating	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	in	abuild	tool	
2.	Translating	the	source	code	into	an	intermediate	translated	format	
3.	Scanning	the	translated	code	and	producing	security	vulnerability	reports	
4.	Auditing	the	results	of	the	scan,	either	by	opening	the	results	(typically	an	FPR	file)	in	Micro	Focus	
Fortify	Audit	Workbench	or	uploading	them	to	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	for	
analysis,	or	working	directly	with	the	results	displayed	on	screen.	
Note:	For	information	about	how	to	open	and	view	results	in	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	or	Fortify	
Software	Security	Center	,see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	User	Guide	or	the	Micro	
Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	User	Guide	respectively.

Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	
You	can	use	Micro	Focus	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	to	manage	your	resources	by	offloading	the	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	scan	phase	from	build	machines	to	acollection	of	machines	provisioned	for	this	
purpose.	For	some	languages,	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	can	perform	both	the	translation	and	the	
analysis	(scan)	phases.	You	can	analyze	your	code	in	one	of	two	ways:	
l	Perform	the	translation	phase	on	alocal	build	machine	and	generate	amobile	build	session	(MBS).	
Start	the	scan	with	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	using	the	MBS	file.	In	addition	to	freeing	up	the	build	
machines,	this	process	makes	it	easy	to	expand	the	system	by	adding	more	resources	as	needed,	
without	having	to	interrupt	the	build	process.	In	addition,	users	of	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	
Security	Center	can	direct	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	to	output	the	FPR	file	directly	to	the	server.	
l	If	your	application	is	written	in	alanguage	supported	for	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	translation,	you	
can	also	offload	the	translation	phase	of	the	analysis	to	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	.For	information	
about	the	specific	supported	language,	see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	System	Requirements	
document.	
For	detailed	information	about	how	to	use	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	,see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	
ScanCentral	SAST	Installation,	Configuration,	and	Usage	Guide	.	
Fortify	Scan	Wizard	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Scan	Wizard	is	autility	that	enables	you	to	quickly	and	easily	generate	ascript	to	
run	on	Windows	or	Linux/	macOS	so	¬†that	you	can	scan	project	code	with	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.	
With	the	Scan	Wizard,	you	can	run	your	scans	locally,	or,	if	you	are	using	Micro	Focus	Fortify	
ScanCentral	SAST	,in	acollection	of	computers	provisioned	to	manage	the	processor-	intensive	scan	
phase	of	the	analysis.	
For	more	information,	see	""Fortify	Scan	Wizard""	on	page	¬†168	.	
Fortify	Software	Security	Content	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	aknowledge	base	of	rules	to	enforce	secure	coding	standards	
applicable	to	the	codebase	for	static	analysis.	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Content	is	required	
for	both	translation	and	analysis.	You	can	download	and	install	security	content	when	you	install	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	(see	""Installing	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer""	on	page	¬†25	).	Alternatively,	you	can	
download	or	import	previously	downloaded	Fortify	Security	Content	with	the	fortifyupdate	utility	as	a	
post-	installation	task	(see	""Manually	Installing	Fortify	Security	Content""	on	page	¬†32	).	
Fortify	Software	Security	Content	(security	content)	consists	of	Secure	Coding	Rulepacks	and	external	
metadata:
l	Secure	Coding	Rulepacks	describe	general	secure	coding	idioms	for	popular	languages	and	public	
APIs	
l	External	metadata	includes	mappings	from	the	Fortify	categories	to	alternative	categories	(such	as	
CWE,	OWASP	Top	10,	and	PCI)	
User	Guide	
Chapter	1:	Introduction	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	18	of	216 

Fortify	provides	the	ability	to	write	custom	rules	that	add	to	the	functionality	of	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	and	the	Secure	Coding	Rulepacks	.For	example,	you	might	need	to	enforce	proprietary	
security	guidelines	or	analyze	aproject	that	uses	third-	party	libraries	or	other	pre-	compiled	binaries	that	
are	not	already	covered	by	the	Secure	Coding	Rulepacks	.You	can	also	customize	the	external	metadata	
to	map	Fortify	issues	to	different	taxonomies,	such	as	internal	application	security	standards	or	
additional	compliance	obligations.	For	instructions	on	how	to	create	your	own	custom	rules	or	custom	
external	metadata,	see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	Custom	Rules	Guide	.	
Fortify	recommends	that	you	periodically	update	the	security	content.	You	can	use	the	fortifyupdate	
utility	to	obtain	the	latest	security	content.	For	more	information,	see	""Updating	Security	Content""	on	
page	¬†127	.	
About	the	Analyzers	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	comprises	eight	vulnerability	analyzers:	Buffer,	Configuration,	Content,	
Control	Flow,	Dataflow,	Higher	Order,	Semantic,	and	Structural.	Each	analyzer	accepts	adifferent	type	
of	rule	specifically	tailored	to	provide	the	information	necessary	for	the	corresponding	type	of	analysis	
performed.	Rules	are	definitions	that	identify	elements	in	the	source	code	that	might	result	in	security	
vulnerabilities	or	are	otherwise	unsafe.	
The	following	table	lists	and	describes	each	analyzer.	
Analyzer	Description	
Buffer	The	Buffer	Analyzer	detects	buffer	overflow	vulnerabilities	that	involve	writing	or	
reading	more	data	than	abuffer	can	hold.	The	buffer	can	be	either	stack-	allocated	
or	heap-	allocated.	The	Buffer	Analyzer	uses	limited	interprocedural	analysis	to	
determine	whether	there	is	acondition	that	causes	the	buffer	to	overflow.	If	any	
execution	path	to	abuffer	leads	to	abuffer	overflow,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
reports	it	as	abuffer	overflow	vulnerability	and	points	out	the	variables	that	could	
cause	the	overflow.	If	the	value	of	the	variable	causing	the	buffer	overflow	is	tainted	
(user-	controlled),	then	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	reports	it	as	well	and	displays	
the	dataflow	trace	to	show	how	the	variable	is	tainted.	
Configuration	The	Configuration	Analyzer	searches	for	mistakes,	weaknesses,	and	policy	violations	
in	application	deployment	configuration	files.	For	example,	the	Configuration	
Analyzer	checks	for	reasonable	timeouts	in	user	sessions	in	aweb	application.	
Content	The	Content	Analyzer	searches	for	security	issues	and	policy	violations	in	HTML	
content.	In	addition	to	static	HTML	pages,	the	Content	Analyzer	performs	these	
checks	on	files	that	contain	dynamic	HTML,	such	as	PHP,	JSP,	and	classic	ASP	files.

Analyzer	Description	
Control	Flow	The	Control	Flow	Analyzer	detects	potentially	dangerous	sequences	of	operations.	
By	analyzing	control	flow	paths	in	aprogram,	the	Control	¬†Flow	Analyzer	determines	
whether	aset	of	operations	are	executed	in	acertain	order.	For	example,	the	Control	
Flow	Analyzer	detects	time	of	check/time	of	use	issues	and	uninitialized	variables,	
and	checks	whether	utilities,	such	as	XML	readers,	are	configured	properly	before	
being	used.	
Dataflow	The	Dataflow	Analyzer	detects	potential	vulnerabilities	that	involve	tainted	data	
(user-	controlled	input)	put	to	potentially	dangerous	use.	The	Dataflow	Analyzer	
uses	global,	interprocedural	taint	propagation	analysis	to	detect	the	flow	of	data	
between	asource	(site	of	user	input)	and	asink	(dangerous	function	call	or	
operation).	For	example,	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	detects	whether	auser-	controlled	
input	string	of	unbounded	length	is	copied	into	astatically	sized	buffer,	and	detects	
whether	auser-	controlled	string	is	used	to	construct	SQL	query	text.	
Null	Pointer	The	Null	Pointer	Analyzer	detects	dereferences	of	pointer	variables	that	are	
assigned	the	null	value.	The	Null	Pointer	¬†Analyzer	detection	is	performed	at	the	
intra-	procedural	level.	Issues	are	detected	only	when	the	null	assignment,	the	
dereference,	and	all	the	paths	between	them	occur	within	asingle	function.	
Semantic	The	Semantic	Analyzer	detects	potentially	dangerous	uses	of	functions	and	APIs	at	
the	intra-	procedural	level.	Its	specialized	logic	searches	for	buffer	overflow,	format	
string,	and	execution	path	issues,	but	is	not	limited	to	these	categories.	For	example,	
the	Semantic	Analyzer	detects	deprecated	functions	in	Java	and	unsafe	functions	in	
C/C++	,such	as	gets	()	.	
Structural	The	Structural	Analyzer	detects	potentially	dangerous	flaws	in	the	structure	or	
definition	of	the	program.	By	understanding	the	way	programs	are	structured,	the	
Structural	Analyzer	identifies	violations	of	secure	programming	practices	and	
techniques	that	are	often	difficult	to	detect	through	inspection	because	they	
encompass	awide	scope	involving	both	the	declaration	and	use	of	variables	and	
functions.	For	example,	the	Structural	Analyzer	detects	assignment	to	member	
variables	in	Java	servlets,	identifies	the	use	of	loggers	that	are	not	declared	static	
final,	and	flags	instances	of	dead	code	that	is	never	executed	because	of	apredicate	
that	is	always	false.

Note:	The	rpm-	build	package	in	SUSE	is	needed	by	the	installer.	
To	create	the	docker	image	using	the	Dockerfile	from	the	current	directory,	you	must	use	the	docker	
build	command.	For	example:	
docker	build	-t	<image_	name>	
Running	the	Container	
This	topic	describes	how	to	run	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	image	as	acontainer	and	provides	
example	Docker	run	commands	for	translation	and	scan.	
To	run	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	image	as	acontainer,	you	must	mount	two	directories	from	the	
host	file	system	to	the	container:	
l	The	directory	that	contains	the	source	files	you	want	to	analyze.	
l	A	temporary	directory	to	store	the	SCA	build	session	between	the	translate	and	scan	phases	and	to	
share	the	output	files	(logs,	FPR)	with	the	host.	
Specify	this	directory	using	the	‚Äìproject-	root	command-	line	option	in	both	the	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	translate	and	scan	commands.	
The	following	example	commands	mount	the	input	directory	/sources	in	/src	and	the	temporary	
directory	in	/scratch_	docker	.The	image	name	in	the	example	is	fortify-	sca	.	
Important!	Include	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	‚Äìfcontainer	option	in	both	the	translate	
and	scan	commands	so	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	detects	and	uses	only	the	memory	
dedicated	to	the	container.	Otherwise,	by	default	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	detects	the	total	
system	memory	because	-autoheap	is	enabled.

About	Upgrading	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	and	
Applications
To	upgrade	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	and	Applications,	install	the	new	version	in	adifferent	location	
than	where	your	current	version	is	installed	and	choose	to	migrate	settings	from	the	previous	
installation.	This	migration	preserves	and	updates	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	artifact	files	located	
in	the	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config	directory.	
If	you	choose	not	to	migrate	any	settings	from	aprevious	release,	Fortify	recommends	that	you	save	a	
backup	of	the	following	data:	
l	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/rules	folder	
l	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/customrules	folder	
l	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/ExternalMetadata	folder	
l	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/CustomExternalMetadata	folder	
l	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/server.properties	file	
After	you	install	the	new	version,	you	can	uninstall	the	previous	version.	For	more	information,	see	
""About	Uninstalling	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	and	Applications""	on	the	next	page	.	
Note:	You	can	leave	the	previous	version	installed.	If	you	have	multiple	versions	installed	on	the	
same	system,	the	most	recently	installed	version	is	invoked	when	you	run	the	command	from	the	
command	line.	Scanning	source	code	from	the	Fortify	Secure	Code	Plugins	also	uses	the	most	
recently	installed	version	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.

Chapter	3:	Analysis	Process	Overview	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Analysis	Process	41	
Translation	Phase	42	
Mobile	Build	Sessions	43	
Analysis	Phase	44	
Translation	and	Analysis	Phase	Verification	46	
Analysis	Process	
There	are	four	distinct	phases	that	make	up	the	analysis	process:	
1.	Build	Integration	‚Äî	Choose	whether	to	integrate	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	into	your	build	tool.	
For	descriptions	of	build	integration	options,	see	""Integrating	into	aBuild""	on	page	¬†105	.	
2.	Translation	‚Äî	Gathers	source	code	using	aseries	of	commands	and	translates	it	into	an	
intermediate	format	associated	with	abuild	ID.	The	build	ID	is	usually	the	name	of	the	project	you	
are	translating.	For	more	information,	see	""Translation	Phase""	on	the	next	page	.	
3.	Analysis	‚Äî	Scans	source	files	identified	in	the	translation	phase	and	generates	an	analysis	results	
file	(typically	in	the	Fortify	Project	Results	(FPR)	format).	FPR	files	have	the	.fpr	file	extension.	
For	more	information,	see	""Analysis	Phase""	on	page	¬†44	.	
4.	Verification	of	translation	and	analysis	‚Äî	Verifies	that	the	source	files	were	scanned	using	the	
correct	Rulepacks	and	that	no	errors	were	reported.	For	more	information,	see	""Translation	and	
Analysis	Phase	Verification""	on	page	¬†46	.	
The	following	is	an	example	of	the	sequence	of	commands	you	use	to	translate	and	analyze	code:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-clean	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	...	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-f	myresults.fpr	
The	three	commands	in	the	previous	example	illustrates	the	following	steps	in	the	analysis	process:	
1.	Remove	all	existing	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	temporary	files	for	the	specified	build	ID.	
Always	begin	an	analysis	with	this	step	to	analyze	aproject	with	apreviously	used	build	ID.	
2.	Translate	the	project	code.	
This	step	can	consist	of	multiple	calls	to	sourceanalyzer	with	the	same	build	ID.	
3.	Analyze	the	project	code	and	produce	the	Fortify	Project	Results	file	(FPR).	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	41	of	216 

Parallel	Processing	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	runs	in	parallel	analysis	mode	to	reduce	the	scan	time	of	large	projects.	This	
takes	advantage	of	all	CPU	cores	available	on	your	system.	When	you	run	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,	
avoid	running	other	substantial	processes	during	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	execution	because	it	
expects	to	have	the	full	resources	of	your	hardware	available	for	the	scan.	
Translation	Phase	
To	successfully	translate	aproject	that	is	normally	compiled,	make	sure	that	you	have	any	dependencies	
required	to	build	the	project	available.	The	chapters	for	each	source	code	type	describe	any	specific	
requirements.
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	perform	the	first	step	of	the	analysis	process,	file	translation,	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	...	<files>	
or
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	...	<compiler_	command>	
The	translation	phase	consists	of	one	or	more	invocations	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	using	the	
sourceanalyzer	command.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	abuild	ID	(-b	option)	to	tie	the	
invocations	together.	Subsequent	invocations	of	sourceanalyzer	add	any	newly	specified	source	or	
configuration	files	to	the	file	list	associated	with	the	build	ID.	
After	translation,	you	can	use	the	-show-	build-	warnings	directive	to	list	any	warnings	and	errors	
that	occurred	in	the	translation	phase:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-show-	build-	warnings	
To	view	the	files	associated	with	abuild	ID,	use	the	-show-	files	directive:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-show-	files	
The	following	chapters	describe	how	to	translate	different	types	of	source	code:

Mobile	Build	Sessions	
With	aFortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	mobile	build	session	(MBS),	you	can	translate	aproject	on	one	
machine	and	scan	it	on	another.	A	mobile	build	session	(MBS	file)	includes	all	the	files	needed	for	the	
analysis	phase.	To	improve	scan	time,	you	can	perform	the	translation	on	the	original	computer	and	
then	move	the	build	session	(MBS	¬†file)	¬†to	abetter	equipped	computer	for	the	scan.	The	developers	can	
run	translations	on	their	own	computers	and	use	only	one	powerful	computer	to	run	large	scans.	
You	must	have	the	same	version	of	Fortify	Security	Content	(Rulepacks)	installed	on	both	the	system	
where	you	are	performing	the	translation	and	the	system	where	you	are	performing	the	analysis.	
Mobile	Build	Session	Version	Compatibility	
The	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	version	on	the	translate	machine	must	be	compatible	with	the	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	version	on	the	analysis	machine.	The	version	number	format	is:	
major.minor.patch.buildnumber	(for	example,	20.2.0	.0240).	The	major	and	minor	portions	of	the	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	version	numbers	on	both	the	translation	and	the	analysis	machines	must	match.	
For	example,	20.2.0	and	20.1.x	are	compatible.	
Note:	Before	version	16.10,	the	major	portion	of	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	version	number	
was	not	the	same	as	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	version	number.	
To	determine	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	version	number,	type	sourceanalyzer	-version	on	
the	command	line.	
Creating	a	Mobile	Build	Session	
On	the	machine	where	you	performed	the	translation,	issue	the	following	command	to	generate	a	
mobile	build	session:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-export-	build-	session	<file>	.mbs	
where	<file>	.mbs	is	the	file	name	you	provide	for	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	mobile	build	
session.
Importing	a	Mobile	Build	Session	
After	you	move	the	<file>	.mbs	file	to	the	machine	where	you	want	to	perform	the	scan,	import	the	
mobile	build	session	into	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	project	root	directory.

To	import	the	mobile	build	session,	type	the	following	command:	
sourceanalyzer	-import-	build-	session	<file>	.mbs	
After	you	import	your	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	mobile	build	session,	you	can	proceed	to	the	
analysis	phase.	Perform	ascan	with	the	same	build	ID	that	was	used	in	the	translation.	
You	cannot	merge	multiple	mobile	build	sessions	into	asingle	MBS	file.	Each	exported	build	session	
must	have	aunique	build	ID.	However,	after	all	the	build	IDs	are	imported	on	the	same	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	installation,	you	can	scan	multiple	build	IDs	in	one	scan	with	the	-b	option	(see	""Analysis	
Phase""	below	).	
Analysis	Phase	
The	analysis	phase	scans	the	intermediate	files	created	during	translation	and	creates	the	vulnerability	
results	file	(FPR).	
The	analysis	phase	consists	of	one	invocation	of	sourceanalyzer	.You	specify	the	build	ID	and	
include	the	-scan	directive	with	any	other	required	analysis	or	output	options	(see	""Analysis	Options""	
on	page	¬†114	and	""Output	Options""	on	page	¬†117	).	
An	example	of	the	basic	command-	line	syntax	for	the	analysis	phase	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-f	myresults.fpr	
Note:	By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	includes	the	source	code	in	the	FPR	file.	
To	combine	multiple	builds	into	asingle	scan	command,	add	the	additional	builds	to	the	command	line:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id1>	-b	<build_	id2>	-b	<build_	id3>	-scan	-f	
myresults.fpr
The	use	of	antivirus	software	can	negatively	impact	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	performance.	If	you	
notice	long	scan	times,	Fortify	recommends	that	you	temporarily	exclude	the	internal	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	files	from	your	antivirus	software	scan.	You	can	also	do	the	same	for	the	directories	
where	the	source	code	resides,	however	the	performance	impact	on	the	Fortify	analysis	is	less	than	with	
the	internal	directories.	
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	creates	internal	files	in	the	following	location:	
l	On	Windows:	c:\Users\	<user>	\AppData\Local\Fortify\sca	<version>	
l	On	non-	Windows:	$HOME/.fortify/sca	<version>	
where	<version>	is	the	version	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	you	are	using.

Higher-	Order	Analysis	
Higher-	Order	Analysis	(HOA)	improves	the	ability	to	track	dataflow	through	higher-	order	code.	Higher-	
order	code	manipulates	functions	as	values,	generating	them	with	anonymous	function	expressions	
(lambda	expressions),	passing	them	as	arguments,	returning	them	as	values,	and	assigning	them	to	
variables	and	to	fields	of	objects.	These	code	patterns	are	common	in	modern	dynamic	languages	such	
as	JavaScript,	TypeScript,	Python,	Ruby,	and	Swift.	
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	performs	Higher-	Order	Analysis	when	you	scan	JavaScript,	
TypeScript,	Python,	Ruby,	and	Swift	code.	For	adescription	of	the	Higher-	Order	Analysis	properties,	
see	""fortify-	sca.properties""	on	page	¬†182	and	search	for	""higher-	order	analysis.""	
Modular	Analysis	
This	release	includes	atechnology	preview	of	modular	analysis.	With	modular	analysis,	you	can	pre-	scan	
libraries	(and	sublibraries)	separately	from	your	core	project.	You	can	then	include	these	pre-	scanned	
libraries	when	you	scan	the	core	project.	Doing	this	might	improve	the	core	project	analysis	performance	
because	you	are	not	rescanning	the	libraries	every	time	you	scan	the	core	project.	Modular	analysis	also	
enables	you	to	scan	aproject	that	references	alibrary	without	requiring	the	library's	source	code,	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	translated	files,	or	custom	rules	used	to	scan	the	library.	This	has	the	added	
benefit	that	you	only	need	to	audit	issues	in	your	core	application.	The	analysis	results	are	more	
streamlined	to	code	that	you	directly	control	and	therefore	you	do	not	need	to	worry	about	issues	in	
code	that	you	do	not	own.	
Modular	analysis	is	currently	available	for	libraries	and	applications	developed	in	Java	and	Java	EE.	
Note:	In	this	release,	you	might	not	see	any	performance	improvements	from	modular	analysis.	
Fortify	is	working	to	optimize	the	performance	of	modular	analysis	in	future	releases.	
You	must	rescan	your	libraries	whenever	you:	
l	Update	to	anew	version	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
l	Update	your	Fortify	security	content	
l	Modify	the	libraries	
Modular	Command-	Line	Examples

Chapter	4:	Translating	Java	Code	
This	section	describes	how	to	translate	Java	code.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	supports	translation	of	Java	EE	¬†applications	(including	JSP	files,	
configuration	files,	and	deployment	descriptors),	¬†Java	Bytecode,	and	Java	code	with	Lombok	
annotations.
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Java	Command-	Line	Syntax	47	
Handling	Resolution	Warnings	50	
Using	FindBugs	51	
Translating	Java	EE	Applications	52	
Translating	Java	Bytecode	53	
Troubleshooting	JSP	Translation	Issues	54	
Java	Command-	Line	Syntax	
To	translate	Java	code,	all	types	defined	in	alibrary	that	are	referenced	in	the	code	must	have	a	
corresponding	definition	in	the	source	code,	aclass	file,	or	aJAR	file.	Include	all	source	files	on	the	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command	line.	
If	your	project	contains	Java	code	that	refers	to	Kotlin	code,	make	sure	that	the	Java	and	Kotlin	code	are	
translated	in	the	same	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	instance	so	that	the	Java	references	to	Kotlin	
elements	are	resolved	correctly.	Kotlin	to	Java	interoperability	does	not	support	Kotlin	files	provided	by	
the	‚Äìsourcepath	option.	For	more	information	about	the	‚Äìsourcepath	option,	see	""Java	Command-	
Line	Options""	on	the	next	page	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	Java	code	is	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-cp	<classpath>	<files>	
With	Java	code,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	can	either:	
l	Emulate	the	compiler,	which	might	be	convenient	for	build	integration	
l	Accept	source	files	directly,	which	is	convenient	for	command-	line	scans	
For	information	about	integrating	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	with	Ant,	see	""Ant	Integration""	on	
page	¬†107	.	
To	have	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	emulate	the	compiler,	type:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	javac	[<translation_	options>	]	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	47	of	216 

To	pass	files	directly	to	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,type:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-cp	<classpath>	[<translation_	options	>]	
<files>	|	<file_	specifiers>	
where:
l	<translation_	options>	are	options	passed	to	the	compiler.	
l	-cp	<classpath>	specifies	the	class	path	to	use	for	the	Java	source	code.	
A	class	path	is	the	path	that	the	Java	runtime	environment	searches	for	classes	and	other	resource	
files.	Include	all	JAR	dependencies	normally	used	to	build	the	project.	The	format	is	the	same	as	what	
javac	expects	(colon-	or	semicolon-	separated	list	of	paths).	
Similar	to	javac,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	loads	classes	in	the	order	they	appear	in	the	class	path.	
If	there	are	multiple	classes	with	the	same	name	in	the	list,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	the	first	
loaded	class.	In	the	following	example,	if	both	A.jar	and	B.jar	include	aclass	called	
MyData.class	,Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	the	MyData.class	from	A.jar	.	
sourceanalyzer	-cp	A.jar:B.jar	myfile.java	
Fortify	strongly	recommends	that	you	avoid	using	duplicate	classes	with	the	-cp	option.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	loads	JAR	files	in	the	following	order:	
a.	From	the	-cp	option	
b.	From	jre/lib	
c.	From	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/default_	jars	
This	enables	you	to	override	alibrary	class	by	including	the	similarly-	named	class	in	aJAR	¬†specified	
with	the	-cp	option.	
For	descriptions	of	all	the	available	Java-	specific	command-	line	options,	see	""Java	Command-	Line	
Options""	below	.	
Java	Command-	Line	Options	
The	following	table	describes	the	Java	command-	line	options	(for	Java	¬†SE	and	Java	¬†EE).

-cp¬†	<dirs>	|	
-classpath	<dirs>	
Specifies	the	class	path	to	use	for	analyzing	Java	source	code.	
The	format	is	the	same	as	javac:	acolon-	or	semicolon-	
separated	list	of	directories.	You	can	use	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	file	specifiers	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
-cp	""build/classes:lib/*.jar""	
For	information	about	file	specifiers,	see	""Specifying	Files	and	
Directories""	on	page	¬†123	.	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.JavaClasspath	
-extdirs	<dirs>	Similar	to	the	javac	extdirs	option,	accepts	acolon-	or	
semicolon-	separated	list	of	directories.	Any	JAR	¬†files	found	in	
these	directories	are	included	implicitly	on	the	class	path.	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.JavaExtdirs	
-java-	build-	dir	<dirs>	Specifies	one	or	more	directories	that	contain	compiled	Java	
sources.	You	must	specify	this	for	FindBugs	results	as	
described	in	""Analysis	Options""	on	page	¬†114	.	
-source¬†	<version>	|¬†	
-jdk¬†	<version>

used	for	name	resolution.	The	source	path	is	similar	to	class	
path,	except	it	uses	source	files	instead	of	class	files	for	
resolution.	Only	source	files	that	are	referenced	by	the	target	
file	list	are	translated.	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.JavaSourcePath	
Java	Command-	Line	Examples	
To	translate	asingle	file	named	MyServlet.java	with	javaee.jar	as	the	class	path,	type:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyServlet	-cp	lib/javaee.jar	MyServlet.java	
To	translate	all	.java	files	in	the	src	directory	using	all	JAR	¬†files	in	the	lib	directory	as	aclass	path,	
type:
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyProject	-cp	""lib/*.jar""	""src/**/*.java""	
To	translate	and	compile	the	MyCode.java	file	with	the	javac	compiler,	type:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyProject	javac	-classpath	libs.jar	MyCode.java	
Handling	Resolution	Warnings	
To	see	all	warnings	that	were	generated	during	translation,	type	the	following	command	before	you	
start	the	scan	phase:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-show-	build-	warnings	
Java	Warnings	
You	might	see	the	following	warnings	for	Java:	
Unable	to	resolve	type...	
Unable	to	resolve	function...	
Unable	to	resolve	field...	
Unable	to	locate	import...	
Unable	to	resolve	symbol...

Multiple	definitions	found	for	function...	
Multiple	definitions	found	for	class...	
These	warnings	are	typically	caused	by	missing	resources.	For	example,	some	of	the	.jar	and	.class	
files	required	to	build	the	application	might	not	have	been	specified.	To	resolve	the	warnings,	make	sure	
that	you	include	all	the	required	files	that	your	application	uses.	
Using	FindBugs	
FindBugs	(http://findbugs.sourceforge.net	)is	astatic	analysis	tool	that	detects	quality	issues	in	Java	
code.	You	can	run	FindBugs	with	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	and	the	results	are	integrated	into	the	
analysis	results	file.	Unlike	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,which	runs	on	Java	source	files,	FindBugs	runs	
on	Java	bytecode.	Therefore,	before	you	run	an	analysis	on	your	project,	first	compile	the	project	and	
produce	the	class	files.	
To	see	an	example	of	how	to	run	FindBugs	automatically	with	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,compile	the	
sample	code	Warning.java	as	follows:	
1.	Go	to	the	following	directory:	
<sca_	install_	dir>	/Samples/advanced/findbugs	
2.	Type	the	following	commands	to	compile	the	sample:	
mkdir	build	
javac	-d	build	Warning.java	
3.	Scan	the	sample	with	FindBugs	and	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	as	follows:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	findbugs_	sample	-java-	build-	dir	build	Warning.java	
sourceanalyzer	-b	findbugs_	sample	-scan	-findbugs	-f	myresults.fpr	
4.	Examine	the	analysis	results	in	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	:	
auditworkbench	myresults.fpr	
The	output	contains	the	following	issue	categories:	
l	Bad	casts	of	Object	References	(1)	
l	Dead	local	store	(2)	
l	Equal	objects	must	have	equal	hashcodes	(1)	
l	Object	model	violation	(1)	
l	Unwritten	field	(2)	
l	Useless	self-	assignment	(2)	
User	Guide	
Chapter	4:	Translating	Java	Code	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	51	of	216 

If	you	group	by	analyzer,	you	can	see	that	the	Structural	Analyzer	produced	one	issue	and	FindBugs	
produced	eight.	The	Object	model	violation	issue	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	detected	on	line	
25	is	similar	to	the	Equal	objects	must	have	equal	hash	codes	issue	that	FindBugs	detected.	
In	addition,	FindBugs	produces	two	sets	of	issues	(Useless	self-	assignment	and	Dead	local	
store	)about	the	same	vulnerabilities	on	lines	6	and	7.	To	avoid	overlapping	results,	use	the	-filter	
option	during	the	scan	to	apply	the	filter.txt	filter	file.	Note	that	the	filtering	is	not	complete	
because	each	tool	filters	at	adifferent	level	of	granularity.	To	see	how	to	avoid	overlapping	results,	scan	
the	sample	code	using	filter.txt	as	follows:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	findbugs_	sample	-scan	-findbugs	-filter	filter.txt	
-f	myresults.fpr	
Translating	Java	EE	Applications	
To	translate	Java	EE	¬†applications,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	processes	Java	source	files	and	
Java	¬†EE	¬†components	such	as	JSP	files,	deployment	descriptors,	and	configuration	files.	While	you	can	
process	all	the	pertinent	files	in	aJava	¬†EE	application	in	one	step,	your	project	might	require	that	you	
break	the	procedure	into	its	components	for	integration	in	abuild	process	or	to	meet	the	needs	of	
various	stakeholders	in	your	organization.	
Translating	Java	Files	
To	translate	Java	EE	applications,	use	the	same	procedure	used	to	translate	Java	files.	For	examples,	see	
""Java	Command-	Line	Examples""	on	page	¬†50	.	
Translating	JSP	Projects,	Configuration	Files,	and	Deployment	
Descriptors
In	addition	to	translating	the	Java	files	in	your	Java	¬†EE	application,	you	might	also	need	to	translate	JSP	
files,	configuration	files,	and	deployment	descriptors.	Your	JSP	files	must	be	part	of	aWeb	Application	
Archive	(WAR).	If	your	source	directory	is	already	organized	in	aWAR	file	format,	you	can	translate	the	
JSP	files	directly	from	the	source	directory.	If	not,	you	might	need	to	deploy	your	application	and	
translate	the	JSP	files	from	the	deployment	directory.	
For	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyJavaApp	""/**/*.jsp""	""/**/*.xml""	
where	/**/*.jsp	refers	to	the	location	of	your	JSP	project	files	and	/**/*.xml	refers	to	the	location	
of	your	configuration	and	deployment	descriptor	files.

Java	EE	Translation	Warnings	
You	might	see	the	following	warning	in	the	translation	of	Java	EE	¬†applications:	
Could	not	locate	the	root	(WEB-	INF)	of	the	web	application.	Please	build	
your	web	application	and	try	again.	Failed	to	parse	the	following	jsp	
files:
<list_	of_	jsp_	files>	
This	warning	indicates	that	your	web	application	is	not	deployed	in	the	standard	WAR	directory	format	
or	does	not	contain	the	full	set	of	required	libraries.	To	resolve	the	warning,	make	sure	that	your	web	
application	is	in	an	exploded	WAR	directory	format	with	the	correct	WEB-	INF/lib	and	WEB-	
INF/classes	directories	containing	all	of	the	.jar	and	.class	files	required	for	your	application.	
Also	verify	that	you	have	all	of	the	TLD	files	for	all	of	your	tags	and	the	corresponding	JAR	files	with	
their	tag	implementations.	
Translating	Java	Bytecode	
In	addition	to	translating	source	code,	you	can	translate	the	bytecode	in	your	project.	You	must	specify	
two	configuration	properties	and	include	the	bytecode	files	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
translation	phase.	
For	best	results,	Fortify	recommends	that	the	bytecode	be	compiled	with	full	debug	information	
(javac¬†-	g).	
Fortify	recommends	that	you	do	not	translate	Java	bytecode	and	JSP/Java	code	in	the	same	call	to	
sourceanalyzer	.Use	multiple	invocations	of	sourceanalyzer	with	the	same	build	ID	to	translate	a	
project	that	contains	both	bytecode	and	JSP/Java	¬†code.	
To	include	bytecode	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation:	
1.	Add	the	following	properties	to	the	fortify-	sca.properties	file	(or	include	these	properties	
on	the	command	line	using	the	-D	option):	
com.fortify.sca.fileextensions.class=BYTECODE
com.fortify.sca.fileextensions.jar=ARCHIVE
This	specifies	how	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	processes	.class	and	.jar	files.	
2.	In	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation	phase,	specify	the	Java	bytecode	files	that	you	want	
to	translate.	For	best	performance,	specify	only	the	.jar	or	.class	files	that	require	scanning.	
In	the	following	example,	the	.class	files	are	translated:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyProject	-cp	""lib/*.jar""	""src/**/*.class""

Troubleshooting	JSP	Translation	Issues	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	either	the	built-	in	compiler	or	your	specific	application	server	JSP	
compiler	to	translate	JSP	files	into	Java	files	for	analysis.	If	the	JSP	parser	encounters	problems	when	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	converts	JSP	files	to	Java	files,	you	will	see	amessage	similar	to	the	
following:
Failed	to	translate	the	following	jsps	into	analysis	model.	Please	see	the	
log	file	for	any	errors	from	the	jsp	parser	and	the	user	manual	for	hints	
on	fixing	those	
<list_	of_	jsp_	files>	
This	typically	happens	for	one	or	more	of	the	following	reasons:	
l	The	web	application	is	not	laid	out	in	aproper	deployable	WAR	directory	format	
l	You	are	missing	some	JAR	files	or	classes	required	for	the	application	
l	You	are	missing	some	tag	libraries	or	their	definitions	(TLD)	for	the	application

Chapter	5:	Translating	Kotlin	Code	
This	section	describes	how	to	translate	Kotlin	code.	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Kotlin	Command-	Line	Syntax	55	
Kotlin	and	Java	Translation	Interoperability	57	
Kotlin	Command-	Line	Syntax	
The	translation	of	Kotlin	code	is	similar	to	the	translation	of	Java	code.	To	translate	Kotlin	code,	all	types	
defined	in	alibrary	that	are	referenced	in	the	code	must	have	acorresponding	definition	in	the	source	
code,	aclass	file,	or	aJAR	file.	Include	all	source	files	on	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command	line.	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	Kotlin	code	is	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	-cp	<classpath>	[<translation_	options>	]	
<files>
where
l	-cp	<classpath>	specifies	the	class	path	to	use	for	the	Kotlin	source	code.	
A	class	path	is	the	path	that	the	Java	runtime	environment	searches	for	classes	and	other	resource	
files.	Include	all	JAR	dependencies	normally	used	to	build	the	project.	The	format	is	acolon-	or	
semicolon-	separated	list	of	paths.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	loads	classes	in	the	order	they	appear	in	the	class	path.	If	there	are	
multiple	classes	with	the	same	name	in	the	list,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	the	first	loaded	class.	
In	the	following	example,	if	both	A.jar	and	B.jar	include	aclass	called	MyData.class	,Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	the	MyData.class	from	A.jar	.	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìcp	""A.jar:B.jar""	myfile.kt	
Fortify	strongly	recommends	that	you	avoid	using	duplicate	classes	with	the	-cp	option.	
For	descriptions	of	all	the	available	Kotlin-	specific	command-	line	options,	see	""Kotlin	Command-	Line	
Options""	on	the	next	page	.

Kotlin	Command-	Line	Options	
The	following	table	describes	the	Kotlin-	specific	command-	line	options.	
Kotlin	Option	Description	
-cp¬†	<paths>	|	
-classpath	<dirs>	
Specifies	the	class	path	to	use	for	translating	Kotlin	source	
code,	which	is	acolon-	or	semicolon-	separated	list	of	
directories.	You	can	use	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	file	
specifiers	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
-cp	""build/classes:lib/*.jar""	
For	information	about	file	specifiers,	see	""Specifying	Files	and	
Directories""	on	page	¬†123	.	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.JavaClasspath	
-sourcepath	<dirs>	Specifies	acolon-	or	semicolon-	separated	list	of	directories	
that	contain	source	code	that	is	not	included	in	the	scan	but	is	
used	for	name	resolution.	The	source	path	is	similar	to	class	
path,	except	it	uses	source	files	instead	of	class	files	for	
resolution.	Only	source	files	that	are	referenced	by	the	target	
file	list	are	translated.

To	translate	all	files	in	the	src	directory	using	Java	dependencies	from	src/java	and	all	JAR	files	in	
the	lib	directory	and	subdirectories	as	aclass	path,	type:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	MyProject	‚Äìcp	""lib/**/*.jar""	-sourcepath	""src/java""	
""src""
Kotlin	and	Java	Translation	Interoperability	
If	your	project	contains	Kotlin	code	that	refers	to	Java	code,	you	can	provide	Java	files	to	the	translator	
the	same	way	as	Kotlin	files	that	refers	to	another	Kotlin	file.	You	can	provide	them	as	part	of	the	
translated	project	source	or	as	‚Äìsourcepath	parameters.	
If	your	project	contains	Java	code	that	refers	to	Kotlin	code,	make	sure	that	the	Java	and	Kotlin	code	are	
translated	in	the	same	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	instance	so	that	the	Java	references	to	Kotlin	
elements	are	resolved	correctly.	Kotlin	to	Java	interoperability	does	not	support	Kotlin	files	provided	by	
the	‚Äìsourcepath	option.	For	more	information	about	the	‚Äìsourcepath	option,	see	""Kotlin

Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	supports	translation	of	the	following	types	of	projects	built	with	Visual	
Studio	or	MSBuild:	
l	C/C++	projects	
l	.NET	projects	written	in	C#	or	Visual	Basic	(VB.NET)	
This	includes	projects	that	target	.NET	¬†Framework,	.NET	¬†Core,	and	.NET	¬†Standard	
l	ASP.NET	applications	
This	includes	applications	that	make	use	of	the	ASP.NET	¬†Core	framework

Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	Project	Translation	
Prerequisites
Important!	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	supports	translation	of	Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	
projects	on	Windows	systems	only.	
Fortify	recommends	that	each	project	you	translate	is	complete	and	that	you	perform	the	translation	in	
an	environment	where	you	can	build	it	without	errors.	A¬†complete	project	contains	the	following:	
l	All	necessary	source	code	files	(C/C++,	C#,	or	VB.NET)	
l	All	required	reference	libraries	
This	includes	those	from	relevant	frameworks,	NuGet	packages,	and	third-	party	libraries.	
l	For	C/C++	projects,	include	all	necessary	header	files	that	do	not	belong	to	the	Visual	Studio	or	
MSBuild	installation	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	58	of	216 

l	For	ASP.NET	and	ASP.NET	Core	projects,	include	all	the	necessary	ASP.NET	page	files	
The	supported	ASP.NET	page	types	are	ASPX,	ASCX,	ASAX,	ASHX,	ASMX,	AXML,	Master,	
CSHTML,	VBHTML,	BAML,	and	XAML.	
Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	Project	Translation	
Command-	Line	Syntax	
The	basic	syntax	to	translate	Visual	Studio	or	MSBuild	projects	is	to	append	an	MSBuild	command	that	
builds	the	project	to	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command.	The	following	command	translates	a	
Visual	Studio	solution	called	Sample.sln	:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	msbuild	/t:rebuild	Sample.sln	
This	command	first	builds	the	solution	or	project	and	then	translates	it.	Fortify	strongly	recommends	
you	run	this	command	from	the	Developer	Command	Prompt	for	Visual	Studio	to	ensure	an	optimal	
environment	for	the	translation.	
Important!	When	you	translate	from	the	Developer	Command	Prompt	for	Visual	Studio	
environment,	Fortify	recommends	that	you	run	the	dotnet	restore	command	before	you	run	
the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation.	You	must	run	this	command	from	the	top-	level	folder	
of	the	project.	This	ensures	that	all	required	reference	libraries	are	downloaded	and	installed	in	the	
project.
After	the	translation	is	complete,	you	can	perform	the	analysis	phase	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	-scan	-f	<results>	.fpr	
Handling	Special	Cases	for	Translating	Visual	Studio	
and	MSBuild	Projects	
Running	Translation	From	a	Script	
As	stated	previously,	Fortify	recommends	that	you	run	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation	of	
Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	projects	from	the	Developer	Command	Prompt	for	Visual	Studio.	To	
perform	the	translation	in	anon-	interactive	mode	such	as	with	ascript,	establish	an	optimal	
environment	for	translation	by	executing	the	following	command	before	you	run	the	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	translation:	
cmd.exe	/k	<vs_	install_	dir>	/Common7/Tools/VSDevCmd.bat	
where	<vs_	install_	dir>	¬†is	the	directory	where	you	installed	Visual	Studio.

Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	59	of	216 

Translating	Plain	.NET	and	ASP.NET	Projects	
You	can	translate	plain	.NET	and	ASP.NET	projects	from	the	Windows	Command	Prompt	as	well	as	
from	aVisual	Studio	environment.	When	you	translate	from	the	Windows	Command	Prompt,	make	sure	
the	path	to	the	MSBuild	executable	required	to	build	your	project	is	included	in	PATH	environment	
variable.
Translating	C/C++	and	Xamarin	Projects	
Important!	You	must	translate	C/C++	and	Xamarin	projects	either	from	aDeveloper	Command	
Prompt	for	Visual	Studio	or	from	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Extension	for	Visual	Studio	.	
Additionally,	Fortify	recommends	that	you	translate	Xamarin	projects	from	the	Visual	Studio	2019	
environment,	even	if	you	created	the	project	with	adifferent	version	of	Visual	Studio.	Using	adifferent	
Visual	Studio	version	environment	for	translation	might	reduce	the	quality	of	the	analysis	results.	
Translating	Projects	with	Settings	Containing	Spaces	
If	your	project	is	built	with	aconfiguration	or	other	settings	file	that	contains	spaces,	make	sure	to	do	
the	following	in	the	MSBuild	command:	
l	Enclose	the	setting	value	in	quotes	(in	addition	to	the	quotes	around	the	appropriate	command-	line	
option)	
l	Quotes	are	escaped	
For	example,	to	translate	aVisual	Studio	solution	Sample.sln	that	is	built	with	configuration	My	
Configuration	,use	the	following	command:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	msbuild	/t:rebuild	
""/p:Configuration=\"My	Configuration\"""	Sample.sln	
Translating	a	Single	Project	from	a	Visual	Studio	Solution	
If	your	Visual	Studio	solution	contains	multiple	projects,	you	have	the	option	to	translate	asingle	
project	instead	of	the	entire	solution.	Project	files	have	afile	name	extension	that	ends	with	proj	such	
as	.vcxproj	and	.csproj	.To	translate	asingle	project,	specify	the	project	file	instead	of	the	solution	
as	the	parameter	for	the	MSBuild	command.	
The	following	example	translates	the	Sample.vcxproj	project	file:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	msbuild	/t:rebuild	Sample.vcxproj	
User	Guide

Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	60	of	216 

Translating	Visual	Studio	Solutions	with	Excluded	or	Skipped	
Projects
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	all	projects	in	the	solution	specified	on	the	command	
line,	even	if	some	projects	are	explicitly	excluded	from	build	in	the	solution	or	skipped	during	the	build	
due	to	platform	and	configuration	settings	used.	To	skip	these	excluded	or	skipped	projects	from	the	
translation,	add	the	‚Äìexclude-	disabled-	projects	option	to	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
command	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	-exclude-	disabled-	projects	msbuild	/t:rebuild	
Sample.sln
Working	with	Multiple	Targets	and	Projects	for	MSBuild	Command	
Recent	versions	of	MSBuild	enable	you	to	build	multiple	targets	and	specific	projects	using	an	extended	
syntax	of	the	/t	option.	However,	Fortify	recommends	that	you	avoid	this	syntax	for	translating	Visual	
Studio	or	MSBuild	projects.	Specifying	asingle	rebuild	target	is	sufficient	to	translate	any	supported	
Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	project.	
If	you	cannot	use	asingle	rebuild	target	to	translate	your	project,	Fortify	provides	limited	support	of	
multiple	targets	and	projects	specified	for	the	MSBuild	command.	To	use	this	feature,	add	the	‚Äì	
multiple-	msbuild-	targets	option	to	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command,	as	shown	in	the	
following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	-multiple-	msbuild-	targets	msbuild	
/t:Project1:build;Project2:build	Sample.sln	
Note:	Support	of	this	translation	mode	is	limited	and	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	might	not	
properly	handle	all	possible	combinations	of	targets	and	projects.	
Important!	If	you	use	this	translation	mode,	do	not	specify	aclean	target	as	the	last	target	on	the	
list.	This	target	removes	dependencies	that	your	Visual	Studio	or	MSBuild	project	requires.	This	
drastically	reduces	the	translation	quality	and	can	negatively	impact	the	analysis	results.	
Analyzing	Projects	That	Build	Multiple	Executable	Files	
If	your	Visual	Studio	or	MSBuild	project	builds	multiple	executable	files	(such	as	files	with	the	file	name	
extension	*.exe	),	Fortify	strongly	recommends	that	you	run	the	analysis	phase	separately	for	each	
executable	file	to	avoid	false	positive	issues	in	the	analysis	results.	To	do	this,	use	‚Äìbinary-	name	
option	when	running	the	analysis	phase	and	specify	the	executable	file	name	or	.NET	assembly	name	as	
the	parameter.	
The	following	example	shows	how	to	translate	and	analyze	aVisual	Studio	solution	Sample.sln	that	
consists	of	two	projects,	Sample1	(a	C++	project	with	no	associated	.NET	assembly	name)	and	Sample2	
User	Guide	
Chapter	6:	Translating	Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	Projects	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	61	of	216 

(a	.NET	project	with	.NET	assembly	name	Sample2	).	Each	project	builds	aseparate	executable	file,	
Sample1.exe	and	Sample2.exe	,respectively.	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	msbuild	/t:rebuild	Sample.sln	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-binary-	name	Sample1.exe	-f	Sample1.fpr	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-binary-	name	Sample2	-f	Sample2.fpr	
For	more	information	about	the	-binary-	name	option,	see	""Analysis	Options""	on	page	¬†114	.	
Alternative	Ways	to	Translate	Visual	Studio	and	
MSBuild	Projects	
This	section	describes	alternative	methods	of	translating	Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	projects.	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Alternative	Translation	Options	for	Visual	Studio	Solutions	
The	following	are	two	alternative	ways	of	translation	available	only	for	Visual	Studio	solutions:	
l	Use	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Extension	for	Visual	Studio	
The	Fortify	Extension	for	Visual	Studio	runs	the	translation	and	analysis	(scan)	phases	together	in	
one	step.	
l	Append	adevenv	command	to	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command	
The	following	command	translates	aVisual	Studio	solution	called	Sample.sln	:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	devenv	Sample.sln	/rebuild	
Note	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	converts	adevenv	invocation	to	the	equivalent	MSBuild	
invocation,	therefore	in	this	case	the	solution	with	this	command	is	actually	built	by	MSBuild	instead	
of	the	devenv	tool.	
Translating	Without	Explicitly	Running	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer
You	have	the	option	to	translate	your	Visual	Studio	or	MSBuild	project	without	invoking	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	directly.	This	requires	the	MSbuild	extension	file	named	
FortifyMSBuildTouchless.dll	located	in	the	\Core\lib	directory	where	you	have	installed	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.Specify	this	MSBuild	extension	file	using	an	absolute	or	relative	path	in	
the	MSBuild	command	that	builds	your	project	with	the	/logger	option.	For	example:	
msbuild	/t:rebuild	/logger:	<sca_	install_	dir>	\Core\lib\FortifyMSBuildTouchless.dll

There	are	several	environment	variables	that	you	can	set	to	configure	the	translation	of	your	project.	
Most	of	them	have	default	values,	which	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	if	the	variable	is	not	set.	
These	variables	are	listed	in	the	following	table.

BUILDID	
Specifies	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	build	
ID	for	translation.	Make	sure	that	you	set	this	
value.
This	is	equivalent	to	the	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	's	-b	option.	
None

Important!	The	chapter	describes	how	to	translate	C	and	C++	code	that	is	not	apart	of	aVisual	
Studio	or	MSBuild	project.	For	instructions	on	translating	Visual	Studio	or	MSBuild	projects,	see	
""Translating	Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	Projects""	on	page	¬†58	.

C/C++	Precompiled	Header	Files	65	
Troubleshooting	Translation	Failed	Message	65	
C	and	C++	¬†Code	Translation	Prerequisites	
Make	sure	that	you	have	any	dependencies	required	to	build	the	project	available,	including	headers	for	
third-	party	libraries.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation	does	not	require	object	files	and	
static/dynamic	library	files.	
C	and	C++	Command-	Line	Syntax	
Command-	line	options	passed	to	the	compiler	affect	preprocessor	execution	and	can	enable	or	disable	
language	features	and	extensions.	For	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	interpret	your	source	code	in	the	
same	way	as	the	compiler,	the	translation	phase	for	C/C++	source	code	requires	the	complete	compiler	
command	line.	Prefix	your	original	compiler	command	with	the	sourceanalyzer	command	and	
options.
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	for	translating	asingle	file	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	[<sca_	options>	]	<compiler>	[<compiler_	
options>	]	<file>	.c	
where:
l	<compiler>	is	the	name	of	the	C/C++	compiler	you	use,	such	as	gcc	,g++	,or	cl	.See	the	Micro	
Focus	Fortify	Software	System	Requirements	document	for	alist	of	supported	C/C++	compilers.	
l	<sca_	options>	are	options	passed	to	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	64	of	216 

l	<compiler_	options>	are	options	passed	to	the	C/C++	compiler.	
l	<file>	.c	must	be	in	ASCII	or	UTF-	8	encoding.	
Note:	All	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	¬†options	must	precede	the	compiler	options.	
The	compiler	command	must	successfully	complete	when	executed	on	its	own.	If	the	compiler	command	
fails,	then	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command	prefixed	to	the	compiler	command	also	fails.	
For	example,	if	you	compile	afile	with	the	following	command:	
gcc	-I.	-o	hello.o	-c	helloworld.c	
then	you	can	translate	this	file	with	the	following	command:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	gcc	-I.	-o	hello.o	-c	helloworld.c	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	executes	the	original	compiler	command	as	part	of	the	translation	phase.	In	
the	previous	example,	the	command	produces	both	the	translated	source	suitable	for	scanning,	and	the	
object	file	hello.o	from	the	gcc	execution.	You	can	use	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	-nc	option	
to	disable	the	compiler	execution.	
Scanning	Pre-	processed	C	and	C++	Code	
If,	before	compilation,	your	C/C++	build	executes	athird-	party	C	preprocessor	that	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	does	not	support,	you	must	invoke	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation	on	the	
intermediate	file.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	touchless	build	integration	automatically	translates	the	
intermediate	file	provided	that	your	build	executes	the	unsupported	preprocessor	and	supported	
compiler	as	two	commands	connected	by	atemporary	file	rather	than	apipe	chain.	
C/C++	Precompiled	Header	Files	
Some	C/C++	compilers	support	Precompiled	Header	Files,	which	can	improve	compilation	performance.	
Some	compilers'	implementations	of	this	feature	have	subtle	side-	effects.	When	the	feature	is	enabled,	
the	compiler	might	accept	erroneous	source	code	without	warnings	or	errors.	This	can	result	in	a	
discrepancy	where	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	reports	translation	errors	even	when	your	compiler	
does	not.	
If	you	use	your	compiler's	Precompiled	Header	feature,	disable	Precompiled	Headers,	and	then	perform	
afull	build	to	make	sure	that	your	source	code	compiles	cleanly.	
Troubleshooting	Translation	Failed	Message	
If	your	C	or	C++	application	builds	successfully	but	you	see	one	or	more	‚Äútranslation	failed‚Äù	messages	
during	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translation	phase,	edit	the	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	file	to	change	the	following	line:

Chapter	8:	Translating	JavaScript	and	
TypeScript	Code	
You	can	analyze	JavaScript	projects	that	contain	JavaScript,	TypeScript,	JSX,	and	TSX	¬†source	files,	as	
well	as	JavaScript	embedded	in	HTML	files.	
Some	JavaScript	frameworks	are	transpiled	(source-	to-	source	compilation)	to	plain	JavaScript.	This	
generated	code	is	optimized.,	minimized,	or	both.	Therefore,	you	might	want	to	exclude	it	from	
translation	because	it	would	be	challenging	to	fix	any	vulnerabilities	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	might	
report	in	this	code.	Use	the	-exclude	command-	line	option	to	manually	exclude	this	type	of	code.	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Translating	Pure	JavaScript	Projects	67	
Excluding	Dependencies	67	
Excluding	NPM	¬†Dependencies	68	
Translating	JavaScript	Projects	with	HTML	Files	68	
Including	External	JavaScript	or	HTML	in	the	Translation	69	
Translating	Pure	JavaScript	Projects	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	JavaScript	is:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	<js_	file_	or_	dir>	
where	<js_	file_	or_	dir>	is	the	either	the	name	of	the	JavaScript	file	to	be	translated	or	adirectory	
that	contains	multiple	JavaScript	files.	You	can	also	translate	multiple	files	by	specifying	*.js	for	the	
<js_	file_	or_	dir>	.	
Excluding	Dependencies	
You	can	avoid	translating	specific	dependencies	by	adding	them	to	the	appropriate	property	setting	in	
the	fortify-	sca.properties	file.	Files	specified	in	the	following	properties	are	not	translated:	
l	com.fortify.sca.skip.libraries.ES6	
l	com.fortify.sca.skip.libraries.jQuery	
l	com.fortify.sca.skip.libraries.javascript	
l	com.fortify.sca.skip.libraries.typescript	
Each	property	specifies	alist	of	comma-	or	colon-	separated	file	names	(without	path	information).	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	67	of	216 

The	files	specified	in	these	properties	apply	to	both	local	files	and	files	on	the	internet.	Suppose,	for	
example,	that	the	JavaScript	code	includes	the	following	file	reference:	
<script
src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"">
</script>
By	default,	the	com.fortify.sca.skip.libraries.jQuery	property	in	the	fortify-	
sca.properties	file	includes	jquery.min.js	,and	therefore	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	does	not	
translate	the	file	shown	in	the	previous	example.	Also,	any	local	copy	of	the	jquery.min.js	file	is	not	
translated.
You	can	use	regular	expressions	for	the	file	names.	Note	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	automatically	
inserts	the	regular	expression	'(-?\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?'	before	.min.js	or	.js	for	each	file	name	
included	in	the	com.fortify.sca.skip.libraries.jQuery	property	value.	
Note:	You	can	also	exclude	local	files	or	entire	directories	with	the	-exclude	command-	line	option.	
For	more	information	about	this	option,	see	""Translation	Options""	on	page	¬†112	.	
Excluding	NPM	¬†Dependencies	
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	only	the	NPM	¬†dependences	that	are	imported	in	the	
code.	You	can	change	this	behavior	with	the	following	two	properties:	
l	The	com.fortify.sca.follow.imports	property	directs	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	resolve	
all	imported	files	and	include	them	in	the	translation.	
This	property	is	enabled	by	default.	Setting	this	property	to	false	prevents	NPM	¬†dependencies	that	
are	not	explicitly	included	on	the	command-	line	from	being	included	in	the	translation.	
l	The	com.fortify.sca.exclude.unimported.node.modules	property	directs	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	to	exclude	all	files	in	any	node_	modules	directory	from	the	translation	except	files	that	
are	specifically	imported	by	the	com.fortify.sca.follow.imports	property.	
This	property	is	enabled	by	default	to	avoid	translating	dependencies	that	are	not	needed	for	the	
final	project	such	as	those	only	required	for	the	build	system.	
Translating	JavaScript	Projects	with	HTML	Files	
If	the	project	contains	HTML	files	in	addition	to	JavaScript	files,	set	the	
com.fortify.sca.EnableDOMModeling	property	to	true	in	the	fortify-	sca.properties	file	or	
on	the	command	line	as	follows:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	<js_	file_	or_	dir>	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.EnableDOMModeling=true	
When	you	set	the	com.fortify.sca.EnableDOMModeling	property	to	true,	this	can	decrease	false	
negative	reports	of	DOM-	related	attacks,	such	as	DOM-	related	cross-	site	scripting	issues.	
User	Guide	
Chapter	8:	Translating	JavaScript	and	TypeScript	Code	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	68	of	216 

Note:	If	you	enable	this	option,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	generates	JavaScript	code	to	model	
the	DOM	tree	structure	in	the	HTML	files.	The	duration	of	the	analysis	phase	might	increase	
(because	there	is	more	translated	code	to	analyze).	
If	you	set	the	com.fortify.sca.EnableDOMModeling	property	to	true,	you	can	also	specify	
additional	HTML	¬†tags	for	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	include	in	the	DOM	¬†modeling	with	the	
com.fortify.sca.DOMModeling.tags	property.	By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	includes	
the	following	HTML	¬†tags:	body	,button	,div	,form	,iframe	,input	,head	,html	,and	p.	
For	example,	to	include	the	HTML	tags	ul	and	li	in	the	DOM	¬†model,	use	the	following	command:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	<js_	file_	or_	dir>	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.DOMModeling.tags=ul,li	
Including	External	JavaScript	or	HTML	in	the	
Translation
To	include	external	JavaScript	or	HTML	¬†files	that	are	specified	with	the	src	attribute,	you	can	specify	
which	domains	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	can	download	and	include	in	the	translation	phase.	To	do	
this,	specify	one	or	more	domains	with	the	
com.fortify.sca.JavaScript.src.domain.whitelist	property.	
Note:	You	can	also	set	this	property	globally	in	the	fortify-	sca.properties	file.	
For	example,	you	might	have	the	following	statement	in	your	HTML	file:	
<script	src='http://xyzdomain.com/foo/bar.js'	language='text/javascript'/>	
</script>
If	you	are	confident	that	the	xyzdomain.com	domain	is	asafe	location	from	which	to	download	files,	
then	you	can	include	them	in	the	translation	phase	by	adding	the	following	property	specification	on	
the	command	line:	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.JavaScript.src.domain.whitelist=""xyzdomain.com/foo""
Note:	You	can	omit	the	www.	prefix	from	the	domain	in	the	property	value.	For	example,	if	the	src	
tag	in	the	original	HTML	file	specifies	to	download	files	from	www.google.com	,you	can	specify	
just	the	google.com	domain.	
To	trust	more	than	one	domain,	include	each	domain	separated	by	the	vertical	bar	character	(|)as	
shown	in	the	following	example:	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.JavaScript.src.domain.whitelist=
""xyzdomain.com/foo|abcdomain.com|123.456domain.com‚Äù

Chapter	9:	Translating	Python	Code	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	Python	applications,	and	processes	files	with	the	.py	extension	
as	Python	source	code.	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Python	Translation	Command-	Line	Syntax	71	
Including	Import	Files	71	
Including	Namespace	Packages	72	
Using	the	Django	Framework	with	Python	72	
Python	Command-	Line	Options	72	
Python	Command-	Line	Examples	73	
Python	Translation	Command-	Line	Syntax	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	Python	code	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-python-	version	<python_	version>	
-python-	path¬†	<dirs>	<files>	
Including	Import	Files	
To	translate	Python	applications	and	prepare	for	ascan,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	searches	for	any	
import	files	used	by	the	application.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	does	not	respect	the	PYTHONPATH	
environment	variable,	which	the	Python	runtime	system	uses	to	find	imported	files.	Specify	all	the	paths	
to	search	for	import	files	with	the	-python-	path	option.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	includes	asubset	of	modules	from	the	standard	Python	library	(module	
""builtins"",	all	modules	originally	written	in	C,	and	others)	in	the	translation.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
first	searches	for	astandard	Python	library	module	in	the	set	included	with	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
and	then	in	the	paths	specified	with	the	-python-	path	option.	If	your	Python	code	imports	any	
module	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	cannot	find,	it	produces	awarning.	To	make	sure	that	all	
modules	of	standard	Python	library	are	found,	add	the	path	to	your	standard	Python	library	to	the	-	
python-	path	list.	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	71	of	216 

Including	Namespace	Packages	
To	translate	namespace	packages,	include	all	the	paths	to	the	namespace	package	directories	in	the	-	
python-	path	option.	For	example,	if	you	have	two	subpackages	for	anamespace	package	package_	
name	in	multiple	folders	as	in	this	example:	
/path_	1/package_	name/subpackageA	
/path_	2/package_	name/subpackageB	
Include	the	following	with	the	-python-	path	option:	/path_	1;/path_	2.	
Using	the	Django	Framework	with	Python	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	supports	the	Django	framework.	To	translate	code	created	using	the	
Django	framework,	add	the	following	properties	to	the	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	configuration	file:	
com.fortify.sca.limiters.MaxPassthroughChainDepth=8
com.fortify.sca.limiters.MaxChainDepth=8
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	attempts	to	discover	Django	templates	in	the	project	root	
folder.	Any	Django	templates	found	are	automatically	added	to	the	translation.	If	you	do	not	want	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	automatically	discover	Django	templates,	use	the	-django-	disable-	
autodiscover	option.	If	your	project	requires	Django	templates,	but	the	project	is	configured	such	
that	Django	templates	are	in	an	unexpected	location,	use	the	-django-	template-	dirs	option	to	
specify	the	directories	that	contain	the	templates	in	addition	to	the	-django-	disable-	
autodiscover	option.	
You	can	specify	additional	locations	of	Django	template	files	by	adding	the	-django-	template-	dirs	
option	to	the	sourceanalyzer	command:	
-django-	template-	dirs	<dirs>

Translating	Apple	iOS	Projects	
This	section	describes	how	to	translate	Swift,	Objective-	C,	and	Objective-	C++	source	code	for	iOS	
applications.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	automatically	integrates	with	the	Xcode	Command	Line	Tool,	
Xcodebuild,	to	identify	the	project	source	files.	
iOS	¬†Project	Translation	Prerequisites	
The	following	are	the	prerequisites	for	translating	iOS	projects:	
l	Objective-	C++	projects	must	use	the	non-	fragile	Objective-	C	runtime	(ABI	version	2	or	3).	
l	Use	Apple‚Äôs	xcode-	select	command-	line	tool	to	set	your	Xcode	path.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
uses	the	system	global	Xcode	configuration	to	find	the	Xcode	toolchain	and	headers.	
l	Make	sure	that	you	have	any	dependencies	required	to	build	the	project	available.	
l	To	translate	Swift	code,	make	sure	that	you	have	available	all	third-	party	modules,	including	
CocoaPods.	Bridging	headers	must	also	be	available.	However,	Xcode	usually	generates	them	
automatically	during	the	build.	
l	If	your	project	includes	property	list	files	in	binary	format,	you	must	first	convert	them	to	XML	format.	
You	can	do	this	with	the	Xcode	putil	command.	
l	To	translate	Objective-	C	projects,	ensure	that	the	headers	for	third-	party	libraries	are	available.	
l	To	translate	WatchKit	applications,	make	sure	that	you	translate	both	the	iPhone	application	target	
and	the	WatchKit	extension	target.

iOS	¬†Code	Analysis	Command-	Line	Syntax	
The	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	iOS	code	using	Xcodebuild	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	xcodebuild	[<compiler_	options>	]	
where	<compiler_	options>	are	the	supported	options	that	are	passed	to	the	Xcode	compiler.	
Note:	Xcodebuild	compiles	the	source	code	when	you	run	this	command.	
If	your	application	uses	any	property	list	files	(for	example,	<file>	.plist	),	translate	these	files	with	a	
separate	sourceanalyzer	command.	Use	the	same	build	ID	that	you	used	to	translate	the	project	files.	
The	following	is	an	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<path_	to_	plist_	files>	
If	your	project	uses	CocoaPods,	include	-workspace	to	build	the	project.	For	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	DemoAppSwift	xcodebuild	clean	build	-workspace	
DemoAppSwift.xcworkspace	-scheme	DemoAppSwift	-sdk	iphonesimulator	
You	can	then	perform	the	analysis	phase,	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	DemoAppSwift	-scan	-f	myresults.fpr	
Translating	Android	Projects	
This	section	describes	how	to	translate	Java	source	code	for	Android	applications.	You	can	use	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	to	scan	the	code	with	Gradle	from	either:	
l	Your	operating	system's	command	line	
l	A	terminal	window	running	in	Android	Studio	
The	way	you	use	Gradle	is	the	same	for	either	method.	
Note:	You	can	also	scan	Android	code	directly	from	Android	Studio	with	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	
Analysis	Plugin	for	IntelliJ	and	Android	Studio	.For	more	information,	see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	
Plugins	for	JetBrains	IDEs	and	Android	Studio	User	Guide	.	
Android	Project	Translation	Prerequisites	
The	following	are	the	prerequisites	for	translating	Android	projects:	
l	Android	Studio	and	the	relevant	Android	SDKs	are	installed	on	the	system	where	you	will	run	the	
scans	
User	Guide	
Chapter	10:	Translating	Code	for	Mobile	Platforms	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	75	of	216 

l	Your	Android	project	uses	Gradle	for	builds.	
If	you	have	an	older	project	that	does	not	use	Gradle,	you	must	add	Gradle	support	to	the	associated	
Android	Studio	project	
Use	the	same	version	of	Gradle	that	is	provided	with	the	version	of	Android	Studio	that	you	use	to	
create	your	Android	project	
l	Make	sure	you	have	available	all	dependencies	that	are	required	to	build	the	Android	code	in	the	
application's	project	
l	To	translate	your	Android	code	from	acommand	window	that	is	not	displayed	within	Android	
Studio,	make	sure	that	Gradle	Wrapper	(gradlew	)¬†is	defined	on	the	system	path	
Android	Code	Analysis	Command-	Line	Syntax	
Use	gradlew	to	scan	Android	projects,	which	is	similar	to	using	Gradle	except	that	you	use	the	Gradle	
Wrapper.	For	information	about	how	to	translate	your	Android	project	using	the	Gradle	Wrapper,	see	
""Gradle	Integration""	on	page	¬†107	.	
Filtering	Issues	Detected	in	Android	Layout	Files	
If	your	Android	project	contains	layout	files	(used	to	design	the	user	interface),	your	project	files	might	
include	R.java	source	files	that	are	automatically	generated	by	Android	Studio.	When	you	scan	the	
project,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	can	detect	issues	associated	with	these	layout	files.	
Fortify	recommends	that	Issues	reported	in	any	layout	file	be	included	in	your	standard	audit	so	you	can	
carefully	determine	if	any	of	them	are	false	positives.	After	you	identify	issues	in	layout	files	that	you	are	
not	interested	in,	you	can	filter	them	out	as	described	in	""Filtering	the	Analysis""	on	page	¬†165	.You	can	
filter	out	the	issues	based	on	the	Instance	ID.

Go	Command-	Line	Syntax	77	
Go	Command-	Line	Options	77	
Resolving	Dependencies	78	
Go	Command-	Line	Syntax	
For	best	results,	your	project	must	be	compilable	and	you	must	have	all	required	dependencies	available.	
The	following	entities	are	excluded	from	the	translation	(and	the	scan):	
l	Vendor	folder	
l	All	projects	defined	by	any	go.mod	files	in	subfolders,	except	the	project	defined	by	the	go.mod	file	
under	the	%PROJECT_	ROOT%	
l	All	files	with	the	_test.go	suffix	(unit	tests)

Go	Command-	Line	Options	
The	following	table	describes	the	command-	line	options	that	are	specific	for	translating	Go	code.	
Go	Option	Description	
-gopath¬†	<path>	Specifies	the	root	directory	of	your	project.	Make	sure	that	the	directory	
structure	adheres	to	the	Go	workspace	hierarchy	
(https://golang.org/doc/gopath_	code.html)	.	
If	this	option	is	not	specified,	then	the	GOPATH	system	environment

Ruby	Command-	Line	Syntax	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	Ruby	code	is:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	<file>	
where	<file>	is	the	name	of	the	Ruby	file	you	want	to	scan.	To	include	multiple	Ruby	files,	separate	
them	with	aspace,	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	file1.rb	file2.rb	file3.rb	
In	addition	to	listing	individual	Ruby	files,	you	can	use	the	asterisk	(*)	wildcard	to	select	all	Ruby	files	in	a	
specified	directory.	For	example,	to	find	all	of	the	Ruby	files	in	adirectory	called	src	,use	the	following	
sourceanalyzer	command:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìb	<build_	id>	src/*.rb	
Ruby	Command-	Line	Options	
The	following	table	describes	the	Ruby	translation	options.

Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	79	of	216 

Adding	Libraries	
If	your	Ruby	source	code	requires	aspecific	library,	add	the	Ruby	library	to	the	sourceanalyzer	
command.	Include	all	ruby	libraries	that	are	installed	with	ruby	gems.	For	example,	if	you	have	a	
utils.rb	file	that	resides	in	the	/usr/share/ruby/myPersonalLibrary	directory,	then	add	the	
following	to	the	sourceanalyzer	command:	
-ruby-	path	/usr/share/ruby/myPersonalLibrary	
To	use	multiple	libraries,	use	adelimited	list.	On	Windows,	separate	the	paths	with	asemicolon;	and	on	
all	other	platforms	use	acolon,	as	in	the	following	non-	Windows	example:	
-ruby-	path	/path/one:/path/two:/path/three	
Adding	Gem	Paths	
To	add	all	RubyGems	and	their	dependency	paths,	import	all	RubyGems.	To	obtain	the	Ruby	gem	paths,	
run	the	gem	env	command.	Under	GEM	PATHS	,look	for	adirectory	similar	to:	
/home/myUser/gems/ruby-	version	
This	directory	contains	another	directory	called	gems	,which	contains	directories	for	all	the	gem	files	
installed	on	the	system.	For	this	example,	use	the	following	in	your	command	line:	
-rubygem-	path	/home/myUser/gems/ruby-	version/gems	
If	you	have	multiple	gems	directories,	add	them	by	specifying	adelimited	list	of	directories	such	as:	
-rubygem-	path	/path/to/gems:/another/path/to/more/gems	
Note:	On	Windows	systems,	separate	the	gems	directories	with	asemicolon.

Chapter	14:	Translating	COBOL	Code	
The	20.2.0	release	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	introduces	updated	COBOL	code	translation,	which	is	
now	the	default	translation	method.	The	previous	translation	method,	referred	to	now	as	legacy	
COBOL	¬†translation,	is	still	available	for	use	with	acommand-	line	option.	Use	the	legacy	
COBOL	¬†translation	method	if	either	of	the	following	is	true:	
l	You	run	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	on	anon-	Windows	operating	system	
l	Your	COBOL	¬†dialect	is	unsupported.	For	example,	your	COBOL	¬†source	code	is	free	format.	
The	following	sections	describe	the	default	COBOL	¬†code	translation.	Information	that	pertains	only	to	
the	legacy	COBOL	translation	is	indicated	as	such.	
For	alist	of	supported	technologies	for	translating	COBOL	¬†code,	see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	
System	Requirements	document.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	does	not	currently	support	custom	rules	
for	COBOL	applications.	
Note:	To	scan	COBOL	with	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,you	must	have	aspecialized	Fortify	license	
specifically	for	COBOL	scanning	capabilities.	Contact	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Customer	Support	for

Before	you	can	analyze	aCOBOL	program,	you	must	copy	the	following	program	components	to	the	
Windows	system	where	you	run	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	:	
l	COBOL	source	code	
Note:	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	COBOL	¬†source	code	files	with	or	without	file	
extensions.	
l	All	copybook	files	that	the	COBOL	source	code	uses	
l	All	SQL	INCLUDE	files	that	the	COBOL	source	code	references	(a	SQL	¬†INCLUDE	file	is	technically	a	
copybook	file)	
Important!	The	copybook	files	must	have	the	file	extension	.CPY	or	.cpy	.	
Legacy	COBOL	¬†Translation:	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	¬†translates	copybook	files	with	or	
without	file	extensions.	
If	your	COBOL	source	code	contains:	
COPY	FOO	
or
EXEC	SQL	INCLUDE	FOO	END-	EXEC	
then	FOO	is	the	name	of	aCOBOL	¬†copybook	and	the	corresponding	copybook	file	has	the	name	
FOO.CPY	or	FOO.cpy	.	
Legacy	COBOL	¬†Translation:	
l	The	corresponding	copybook	file	has	the	name	FOO	with	or	without	afile	extension.	If	the	
copybook	files	have	file	extensions,	use	the	-copy-	extensions	command-	line	option.	For	
more	information,	see	""Legacy	COBOL	¬†Translation	Command-	Line	Options""	on	page	¬†87	.	
l	The	COPY	command	can	also	accept	adirectory-	file-	path	structure	instead	of	afile	name.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	processes	only	top-	level	COBOL	sources.	Do	not	include	copybook	files	in	
the	directory	or	the	subdirectory	where	the	COBOL	sources	reside.	Fortify	recommends	that	you	place	
your	COBOL	source	code	files	in	adirectory	called	sources	and	your	copybook	files	in	adirectory	called	
copybooks	.Create	these	directories	at	the	same	level.	
COBOL	Command-	Line	Syntax	
The	basic	syntax	used	to	translate	asingle	COBOL	source	code	file	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<path>

Translating	ABAP	Code	
Translating	ABAP	code	is	similar	to	translating	other	operating	language	code.	However,	it	requires	
additional	steps	to	extract	the	code	from	the	SAP	database	and	prepare	it	for	scanning.	See	""Importing	
the	Transport	Request""	on	the	next	page	for	more	information.	This	section	assumes	you	have	abasic	
understanding	of	SAP	and	ABAP.	
To	translate	ABAP	code,	the	Fortify	ABAP	Extractor	program	downloads	source	files	to	the	
presentation	server,	and	optionally,	invokes	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.You	need	to	use	an	account	
with	permission	to	download	files	to	the	local	system	and	execute	operating	system	commands.	
Because	the	extractor	program	is	executed	online,	you	might	receive	amax	dialog	work	process	
time	reached	exception	message	if	the	volume	of	source	files	selected	for	extraction	exceeds	the	
allowable	process	run	time.	To	work	around	this,	download	large	projects	as	aseries	of	smaller	Extractor	
tasks.	¬†For	example,	if	your	project	consists	of	four	different	packages,	download	each	package	
separately	into	the	same	project	directory.	¬†If	the	exception	occurs	frequently,	work	with	your	SAP	Basis	
administrator	to	increase	the	maximum	time	limit	(rdisp/max_	wprun_	time	).	
When	aPACKAGE	is	extracted	from	ABAP,	the	Fortify	ABAP	Extractor	extracts	everything	from	TDEVC	
with	aparentcl	field	that	matches	the	package	name.	It	then	recursively	extracts	everything	else	from	
TDEVC	with	aparentcl	field	equal	to	those	already	extracted	from	TDEVC	.The	field	extracted	from	
TDEVC	is	devclass	.	
The	devclass	values	are	treated	as	aset	of	program	names	and	handled	the	same	way	as	aprogram	
name,	which	you	can	provide.	
Programs	are	extracted	from	TRDIR	by	comparing	the	name	field	with	either:	
l	The	program	name	specified	in	the	selection	screen	
l	The	list	of	values	extracted	from	TDEVC	if	apackage	was	provided	
The	rows	from	TRDIR	are	those	for	which	the	name	field	has	the	given	program	name	and	the	
expression	LIKE	programname	is	used	to	extract	rows.

As	source	code	is	downloaded,	the	Fortify	ABAP	Extractor	detects	INCLUDE	statements	in	the	source.	
When	found,	it	downloads	the	include	targets	to	the	local	machine	for	analysis.	
Importing	the	Transport	Request	
To	scan	ABAP	¬†code,	you	need	to	import	the	Fortify	ABAP	Extractor	transport	request	on	your	SAP	
Server.
The	Fortify	transport	request	is	located	in	the	SAP_	Extractor.zip	package.	The	package	is	located	in	
the	Tools	directory:	
<sca_	install_	dir>	/Tools/SAP_	Extractor.zip	
The	Fortify	ABAP	Extractor	package,	SAP_	Extractor.zip	,contains	the	following	files:	
l	K900XXX.S9S	(where	the	‚ÄúXXX‚Äù	is	the	release	number)	
l	R900XXX.S9S	(where	the	‚ÄúXXX‚Äù	is	the	release	number)	
These	files	make	up	the	SAP	transport	request	that	you	must	import	into	your	SAP	system	from	
outside	your	local	Transport	Domain.	Have	your	SAP	administrator	or	an	individual	authorized	to	install	
transport	requests	on	the	system	import	the	transport	request.	
The	NSP	files	contain	aprogram,	atransaction	(YSCA),	and	the	program	user	interface.	After	you	
import	them	into	your	system,	you	can	extract	your	code	from	the	SAP	database	and	prepare	it	for	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	scanning.	
Installation	Note	
The	Fortify	ABAP	Extractor	transport	request	is	supported	on	asystem	running	SAP	release	7.02,	SP	
level	0006.	If	you	are	running	adifferent	SAP	version	and	you	get	the	transport	request	import	error:	
Install	release	does	not	match	the	current	version	,then	the	transport	request	
installation	has	failed.	
To	try	to	resolve	this	issue,	perform	the	following	steps:	
1.	Re-	run	the	transport	request	import.	
The	Import	Transport	Request	dialog	box	opens.	
2.	Click	the	Options	tab.	
3.	Select	the	Ignore	Invalid	Component	Version	check	box.	
4.	Complete	the	import	procedure.

Translating	Flex	and	ActionScript	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	for	translating	ActionScript	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-flex-	libraries	<libs>	<files>	
where:
<libs>	is	asemicolon-	separated	list	(Windows)	or	acolon-	separated	list	(non-	Windows	systems)	of	
library	names	to	which	you	want	to	""link""	and	<files>	¬†are	the	files	to	translate.	
Flex	and	ActionScript	Command-	Line	Options	
Use	the	following	command-	line	options	to	translate	Flex	files.	You	can	also	specify	this	information	in	
the	properties	configuration	file	(fortify-	sca.properties	)¬†as	noted	in	each	description.	
Flex	and	ActionScript	
Option	Description	
-flex-	sdk-	root	
<path>	
The	location	of	the	root	of	avalid	Flex	SDK.	This	folder	must	contain	a	
frameworks	folder	that	contains	aflex-	config.xml	file.	It	must	also	
contain	abin	folder	that	contains	an	MXMLC	executable.	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.FlexSdkRoot	
-flex-	libraries	
<libs>	
A	colon-	or	semicolon-	separated	list	(colon	on	most	platforms,	semicolon	
on	Windows)	of	library	names	that	you	want	to	‚Äúlink‚Äù	to.	In	most	cases,	this	
list	includes	flex.swc	,framework.swc	,and	playerglobal.swc	
(usually	found	in	frameworks/libs/	in	your	Flex	SDK	root).	
Note:	You	can	specify	SWC	or	SWF	files	as	Flex	libraries	(SWZ	is	not	
currently	supported).	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.FlexLibraries	
-flex-	source-	roots	
<dirs>	
A	colon-	or	semicolon-	separated	list	of	root	directories	in	which	MXML	
sources	are	located.	Normally,	these	contain	asubfolder	named	com	.	
For	example,	if	the	Flex	source	root	specified	is	foo/bar/src	,then	
foo/bar/src/com/fortify/manager/util/Foo.mxml	is	
transformed	into	an	object	named	com.fortify.manager.util.Foo	
(an	object	named	Foo	in	the	package	com.fortify.manager.util	).

Flex	and	ActionScript	
Option	Description
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.FlexSourceRoots	
Note:	-flex-	sdk-	root	and	‚Äìflex-	source-	roots	are	primarily	for	MXML	translation,	and	are	
optional	if	you	are	scanning	pure	ActionScript.	Use	‚Äìflex-	libraries	for	resolving	all	
ActionScript.
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	MXML	files	into	ActionScript	and	then	runs	them	through	an	
ActionScript	parser.	The	generated	ActionScript	is	simple	to	analyze;	not	rigorously	correct	like	the	Flex	
runtime	model.	As	aconsequence,	you	might	get	parse	errors	with	MXML	files.	For	instance,	the	XML	
parsing	could	fail,	translation	to	ActionScript	could	fail,	and	the	parsing	of	the	resulting	ActionScript	
could	also	fail.	If	you	see	any	errors	that	do	not	have	aclear	connection	to	the	original	source	code,	
notify	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Customer	Support	.	
ActionScript	Command-	Line	Examples	
The	following	examples	illustrate	command-	line	syntax	for	typical	scenarios	for	translating	ActionScript.	
Example	1	
The	following	example	is	for	asimple	application	that	contains	only	one	MXML	file	and	asingle	SWF	
library	(MyLib.swf	):	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyFlexApp	-flex-	libraries	lib/MyLib.swf	-flex-	sdk-	root	
/home/myself/flex-	sdk/	-flex-	source-	roots	.	my/app/FlexApp.mxml	
This	identifies	the	location	of	the	libraries	to	include	and	the	Flex	SDK	and	the	Flex	source	root	
locations.	The	single	MXML	file,	located	in	/my/app/FlexApp.mxml	,results	in	translating	the	MXML	
application	as	asingle	ActionScript	class	called	FlexApp	and	located	in	the	my.app	package.	
Example	2	
The	following	example	is	for	an	application	in	which	the	source	files	are	relative	to	the	src	directory.	It	
uses	asingle	SWF	library,	MyLib.swf	,and	the	Flex	and	framework	libraries	from	the	Flex	SDK:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyFlexProject	-flex-	sdk-	root	/home/myself/flex-	sdk/	
-flex-	source-	roots	src/	-flex-	libraries	lib/MyLib.swf	""src/**/*.mxml""	
""src/**/*.as""
This	example	locates	the	Flex	SDK	and	uses	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	file	specifiers	to	include	the	
.as	and	.mxml	files	in	the	src	folder.	It	is	not	necessary	to	explicitly	specify	the	.SWC	files	located	in	
the	‚Äìflex-	sdk-	root	,although	this	example	does	so	for	the	purposes	of	illustration.	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	automatically	locates	all	.SWC	files	in	the	specified	Flex	SDK	root,	and	it	assumes	that	
these	are	libraries	intended	for	use	in	translating	ActionScript	or	MXML	¬†files.	
User	Guide	
Chapter	15:	Translating	Other	Languages	and	Configurations	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	98	of	216 

Example	3	
In	this	example,	the	Flex	SDK	root	and	Flex	libraries	are	specified	in	aproperties	file	because	typing	in	
the	data	is	time	consuming	and	the	data	is	generally	constant.	Divide	the	application	into	two	sections	
and	store	them	in	folders:	amain	section	folder	and	amodules	folder.	Each	folder	contains	asrc	folder	
where	the	paths	start.	File	specifiers	contain	wild	cards	to	pick	up	all	the	.mxml	and	.as	files	in	both	src	
folders.	An	MXML	file	in	main/src/com/foo/util/Foo.mxml	is	translated	as	an	ActionScript	class	
named	Foo	in	the	package	com.foo.util	,for	example,	with	the	source	roots	specified	here:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyFlexProject	-flex-	source-	roots	main/src:modules/src	
""./main/src/**/*.mxml""	""./main/src/**/*.as""	""./modules/src/**/*.mxml""	
""./modules/src/**/*.as""
Handling	Resolution	Warnings	
To	see	all	warnings	that	were	generated	during	translation,	type	the	following	command	before	you	
start	the	scan	phase:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-show-	build-	warnings	
ActionScript	Warnings	
You	might	receive	amessage	similar	to	the	following:	
The	ActionScript	front	end	was	unable	to	resolve	the	following	imports:	
a.b	at	y.as:2.	foo.bar	at	somewhere.as:5.	a.b	at	foo.mxml:8.	
This	error	occurs	when	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	cannot	find	all	of	the	required	libraries.	You	might	
need	to	specify	additional	SWC	or	SWF	Flex	libraries	(-flex-	libraries	option	or	
com.fortify.sca.FlexLibraries	property)	so	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	can	complete	the	
analysis.
Translating	ColdFusion	Code	
To	treat	undefined	variables	in	aCFML	page	as	tainted,	uncomment	the	following	line	in	<sca_	
install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	:	
#com.fortify.sca.CfmlUndefinedVariablesAreTainted=true
This	instructs	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	to	watch	out	for	register-	globals-	style	vulnerabilities.	However,	
enabling	this	property	interferes	with	Dataflow	Analyzer	findings	in	which	avariable	in	an	included	page	
is	initialized	to	atainted	value	in	an	earlier-	occurring	included	page.

For	adescription	of	how	to	use	<file_	specifiers>	,see	""Specifying	Files	and	Directories""	on	
page	¬†123	.	
Note:	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	calculates	the	relative	path	to	each	CFML	source	file	with	the	
-source-	base-	dir	directory	as	the	starting	point.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	these	
relative	paths	when	it	generates	instance	IDs.	If	you	move	the	entire	application	source	tree	to	a	
different	directory,	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	-generated	instance	IDs	remain	the	same	if	you	
specify	an	appropriate	parameter	for	the	-source-	base-	dir	option.	
ColdFusion	Command-	Line	Options	
The	following	table	describes	the	ColdFusion	options.	
ColdFusion	Option	Description	
-source-	base-	dir	<web_	app_	root_	dir>	<files>	|

Translating	SQL	
On	Windows	platforms,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	assumes	that	files	with	the	.sql	extension	are	T-	
SQL	rather	than	PL/SQL.	If	you	have	PL/SQL	files	with	the	.sql	extension	on	Windows,	you	must	
configure	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	treat	them	as	PL/SQL.	
To	specify	the	SQL	type	for	translation	on	Windows	platforms,	type	one	of	the	following	translation	
commands:
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-sql-	language	TSQL	<files>	
or
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-sql-	language	PL/SQL	<files>	
User	Guide

Alternatively,	you	can	change	the	default	behavior	for	files	with	the	.sql	extension.	In	the	fortify-	
sca.properties	file,	set	the	com.fortify.sca.fileextensions.sql	property	to	TSQL	or	
PLSQL	.	
PL/SQL	Command-	Line	Example	
The	following	example	shows	the	syntax	to	translate	two	PL/SQL	files:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyProject	x.pks	y.pks

The	following	example	shows	how	to	translate	all	T-	SQL	files	in	the	sources	directory:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	MyProject	""sources\**\*.sql""	
Note:	This	example	assumes	the	com.fortify.sca.fileextensions.sql	property	in	
fortify-	sca.properties	is	set	to	TSQL	.	
Translating	Scala	Code	
To	translate	Scala	code,	you	must	have	astandard	Lightbend	Enterprise	Suite	license.	Download	the	
Scala	translation	plugin	from	Lightbend.	For	instructions	on	how	to	download	and	translate	Scala	code,	
see	the	Lightbend	documentation	at	https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/fortify	.	
Important!	If	your	project	contains	source	code	other	than	Scala,	you	must	translate	the	Scala	
code	using	the	Lightbend's	Scala	translation	plugin,	and	then	translate	the	other	source	code	with	
sourceanalyzer	using	the	same	build	ID	before	you	run	the	scan	phase.	
Translating	ASP/VBScript	Virtual	Roots	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	allows	you	to	handle	ASP	virtual	roots.	For	web	servers	that	use	virtual	
directories	as	aliases	that	map	to	physical	directories,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	enables	you	to	use	an	
alias.
User	Guide	
Chapter	15:	Translating	Other	Languages	and	Configurations	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	101	of	216 

For	example,	you	can	have	virtual	directories	named	Include	and	Library	that	refer	to	the	physical	
directories	C:\WebServer\CustomerOne\inc	and	C:\WebServer\CustomerTwo\Stuff	,	
respectively.
The	following	example	shows	the	ASP/VBScript	code	for	an	application	that	uses	virtual	includes:	
<!-	-#include	virtual=""Include/Task1/foo.inc""-	->	
For	this	example,	the	previous	ASP	code	refers	to	the	file	in	the	following	physical	location:	
C:\Webserver\CustomerOne\inc\Task1\foo.inc
The	real	directory	replaces	the	virtual	directory	name	Include	in	this	example.	
Accommodating	Virtual	Roots	
To	provide	the	mapping	of	each	virtual	directory	to	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,you	must	set	the	
com.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.name_	of_	virtual_	directory	property	in	your	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	command-	line	invocation	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.	<virtual_	
directory>	=<full_	path_	to_	corresponding_	physical_	directory>	
Note:	On	Windows,	if	the	physical	path	includes	spaces,	you	must	enclose	the	property	setting	in	
quotes:
sourceanalyzer	""-	Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.	<virtual_	
directory>	=<full_	path_	to_	corresponding_	physical_	directory>	""	
To	expand	on	the	example	in	the	previous	section,	pass	the	following	property	value	to	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	:	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.Include=""C:\WebServer\CustomerOne\inc""
-Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.Library=""C:\WebServer\CustomerTwo\Stuff""	
This	maps	Include	to	C:\WebServer\CustomerOne\inc	and	Library	to	
C:\WebServer\CustomerTwo\Stuff	.	
When	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	encounters	the	#include	directive:	
<!-	-	#include	virtual=""Include/Task1/foo.inc""	-->	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	determines	if	the	project	contains	aphysical	directory	named	Include	.If	
there	is	no	such	physical	directory,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	looks	through	its	runtime	properties	
and	finds	the	-Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.Include=	
""C:\WebServer\CustomerOne\inc""	setting.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	then	looks	for	this	file:	
C:\WebServer\CustomerOne\inc\Task1\foo.inc	.

Alternatively,	you	can	set	this	property	in	the	fortify-	sca.properties	file	located	in	<sca_	
install_	dir>	\Core\config	.You	must	escape	the	backslash	character	(\)	in	the	path	of	the	physical	
directory	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
com.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.Library=C:\\WebServer\\CustomerTwo\\Stuff
com.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.Include=C:\\WebServer\\CustomerOne\\inc
Note:	The	previous	version	of	the	ASPVirtualRoot	property	is	still	valid.	You	can	use	it	on	the	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command	line	as	follows:	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots=C:\WebServer\CustomerTwo\Stuff;
C:\WebServer\CustomerOne\inc
This	prompts	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	to	search	through	the	listed	directories	in	the	order	specified	
when	it	resolves	avirtual	include	directive.	
Using	Virtual	Roots	Example	
You	have	afile	as	follows:	
C:\files\foo\bar.asp
To	specify	this	file,	use	the	following	include:	
<!-	-	#include	virtual=""/foo/bar.asp"">	
Then	set	the	virtual	root	in	the	sourceanalyzer	command	as	follows:	
-Dcom.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots=C:\files\foo	
This	strips	the	/foo	from	the	front	of	the	virtual	root.	If	you	do	not	specify	foo	in	the	
com.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots	property,	then	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	looks	for	
C:\files\bar.asp	and	fails.	
The	sequence	to	specify	virtual	roots	is	as	follows:	
1.	Remove	the	first	part	of	the	path	in	the	source.	
2.	Replace	the	first	part	of	the	path	with	the	virtual	root	as	specified	on	the	command	line.	
Translating	Dockerfiles	
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	the	following	files	as	Dockerfiles:	Dockerfile	,	
dockerfile	,*.Dockerfile	,and	*.dockerfile	.	
Note:	You	can	modify	the	file	extension	used	to	detect	Dockerfiles	using	the	
com.fortify.sca.fileextensions	property.	See	""fortify-	sca.properties""	on	page	¬†182	.

Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	103	of	216 

Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	accepts	the	following	escape	characters	in	Dockerfiles:	¬†backslash	(\)and	
backquote	(`).	If	the	escape	character	is	not	set	in	the	Dockerfile,	then	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
assumes	that	the	backslash	is	the	escape	character.	
The	syntax	to	translate	adirectory	that	contains	Dockerfiles	is	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<dir>	
If	the	Dockerfile	is	malformed	and	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	cannot	parse	the	file,	an	error	is	written	
to	the	log	and	analysis	of	the	Dockerfile	is	skipped.	The	following	is	an	example	of	the	error	written	to	
the	log:

Build	Integration	
You	can	translate	entire	projects	in	asingle	operation.	Prefix	your	original	build	operation	with	the	
sourceanalyzer	command	followed	by	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	options.	
The	basic	command-	line	syntax	to	translate	acomplete	project	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	[<sca_	options>	]	<build_	tool>	[<build_	tool_	
options>	]	
where	<build_	tool>	is	the	name	of	your	build	tool,	such	as	make,	gmake,	msbuild,	devenv,	or	
xcodebuild.	See	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	System	Requirements	document	for	alist	of	
supported	build	tools.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	executes	your	build	tool	and	intercepts	all	compiler	
operations	to	collect	the	specific	command	line	used	for	each	input.	
Note:	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	only	processes	the	compiler	commands	that	the	build	tool	
executes.	If	you	do	not	clean	your	project	before	you	execute	the	build,	then	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	only	processes	those	files	that	the	build	tool	re-	compiles.	
For	information	about	integrating	with	Xcodebuild,	see	""iOS	¬†Code	Analysis	Command-	Line	Syntax""	on	
page	¬†75	.For	information	about	integration	with	MSBuild,	see	""Translating	Visual	Studio	and	MSBuild	
Projects""	on	page	¬†58	.	
Successful	build	integration	requires	that	the	build	tool:	
l	Executes	aFortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	-supported	compiler	
l	Executes	the	compiler	on	the	operating	system	path	search,	not	with	ahardcoded	path	(This	
requirement	does	not	apply	to	xcodebuild	integration.)	
l	Executes	the	compiler,	rather	than	executing	asub-	process	that	then	executes	the	compiler	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	105	of	216 

If	you	cannot	meet	these	requirements	in	your	environment,	see	""Modifying	aBuild	Script	to	Invoke	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer""	below	.	
Make	Example	
If	you	build	your	project	with	the	following	build	commands:	
make	clean	
make
make	install	
then	you	can	simultaneously	translate	and	compile	the	entire	project	with	the	following	commands:	
make	clean	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	make	
make	install	
Modifying	a	Build	Script	to	Invoke	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer
As	an	alternative	to	build	integration,	you	can	modify	your	build	script	to	prefix	each	compiler,	linker,	
and	archiver	operation	with	the	sourceanalyzer	command.	For	example,	amakefile	often	defines	
variables	for	the	names	of	these	tools:	
CC=gcc
CXX=g++
LD=ld
AR=ar
You	can	prepend	the	tool	references	in	the	makefile	with	the	sourceanalyzer	command	and	the	
appropriate	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	options.	
CC=sourceanalyzer	-b	mybuild	gcc	
CXX=sourceanalyzer	-b	mybuild	g++	
LD=sourceanalyzer	-b	mybuild	ld	
AR=sourceanalyzer	-b	mybuild	ar	
When	you	use	the	same	build	ID	for	each	operation,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	automatically	
combines	each	of	the	separately-	translated	files	into	asingle	translated	project.

Touchless	Build	Integration	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	includes	ageneric	build	tool	called	touchless	that	enables	translation	of	
projects	using	build	systems	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	¬†does	not	directly	support.	The	command-	
line	syntax	for	touchless	build	integration	is:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	touchless	<build_	command>	
For	example,	you	might	use	apython	script	called	build.py	to	compute	dependencies	and	execute	
appropriately-	ordered	C	compiler	operations.	Then	to	execute	your	build,	run	the	following	command:	
python	build.py	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	does	not	have	native	support	for	such	abuild	design.	However,	you	can	
use	the	touchless	build	tool	to	translate	and	build	the	entire	project	with	the	single	command:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	touchless	python	build.py	
The	same	requirements	for	successful	build	integration	with	supported	build	systems	described	earlier	
in	this	chapter	(see	""Build	Integration""	on	page	¬†105	)apply	to	touchless	integration	with	unsupported	
build	systems.	
Ant	Integration	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	provides	an	easy	way	to	translate	Java	source	files	for	projects	that	use	an	
Ant	build	file.	You	can	apply	this	integration	on	the	command	line	without	modifying	the	Ant	
build.xml	file.	When	the	build	runs,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	intercepts	all	javac	task	invocations	
and	translates	the	Java	source	files	as	they	are	compiled.	
Note:	You	must	translate	any	JSP	files,	configuration	files,	or	any	other	non-	Java	source	files	that	
are	part	of	the	application	in	aseparate	step.	
To	use	the	Ant	integration,	make	sure	that	the	sourceanalyzer	executable	is	on	the	system	PATH	.	
Prepend	your	Ant	command-	line	with	the	sourceanalyzer	command	as	follows:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	ant	[<ant_	options>	]	
Gradle	Integration	
You	can	translate	projects	that	are	built	with	Gradle	without	any	modification	of	the	build.gradle	
file.	When	the	build	runs,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	the	source	files	as	they	are	compiled.	
See	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	System	Requirements	document	¬†for	platforms	and	languages	
User	Guide	
Chapter	16:	Integrating	into	aBuild	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	107	of	216 

supported	specifically	for	Gradle	integration.	Any	files	in	the	project	in	unsupported	languages	for	
Gradle	integration	are	not	translated	(with	no	error	reporting).	These	files	are	therefore	not	analyzed,	
and	any	existing	potential	vulnerabilities	can	go	undetected.	
To	integrate	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	into	your	Gradle	build,	make	sure	that	the	sourceanalyzer	
executable	is	on	the	system	PATH.	Prepend	the	Gradle	command	line	with	the	sourceanalyzer	
command	as	follows:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<sca_	options>	gradle	[<gradle_	options>	]	
<gradle	tasks>	
For	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	buildxyz	gradle	clean	build	
sourceanalyzer	-b	buildxyz	gradle	--info	assemble	
If	your	build	file	name	is	different	than	build.gradle	,then	include	the	build	file	name	with	the	--	
build-	file	option	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	buildxyz	gradle	--build-	file	sample.gradle	clean	
assemble
You	can	also	use	the	Gradle	Wrapper	(gradlew	)as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	gradlew	[<gradle_	options>	]	
If	your	application	uses	XML	¬†or	property	configuration	files,	translate	these	files	with	aseparate	
sourceanalyzer	command.	Use	the	same	build	ID	that	you	used	for	the	project	files.	The	following	
are	examples:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<path_	to_	xml_	files>	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<path_	to_	properties_	files>	
After	translating	the	project	with	gradle	or	gradlew,	you	can	then	perform	the	analysis	phase	as	shown	
in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-f	myresults.fpr	
Including	Verbose	and	Debug	Options	
If	you	use	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	-verbose	option,	then	you	must	also	include	the	-gradle	
option.	Use	of	this	option	applies	to	both	Gradle	and	the	Gradle	Wrapper.	For	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	buildxyz	-gradle	-verbose	gradle	assemble	
As	part	of	the	gradle	integration,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	temporarily	updates	the	original	build	file	
build.gradle	.If	you	¬†include	the	-debug	option,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	¬†saves	acopy	of	the	
original	build	file	as	build.gradle.orig	).	After	the	analysis	with	the	-debug	option	is	complete,	
User	Guide	
Chapter	16:	Integrating	into	aBuild	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	108	of	216 

rename	the	build.gradle.orig	file	back	to	build.gradle	and	run	sourceanalyzer	again	without	
the	-debug	option.	
Maven	Integration	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	includes	aMaven	plugin	that	provides	away	to	add	the	following	
capabilities	to	your	Maven	project	builds:	
l	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	clean,	translate,	scan	
l	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	export	mobile	build	session	(MBS)	for	aFortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
translated	project	
l	Send	translated	code	to	Micro	Focus	Fortify	ScanCentral	SAST	
l	Upload	results	to	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	
You	can	use	the	plugin	directly	or	integrate	its	functionality	into	your	build	process.	
Installing	and	Updating	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	
The	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	is	located	in	<sca_	install_	dir>	/plugins/maven	.This	directory	contains	
abinary	and	asource	version	of	the	plugin	in	both	zip	and	tarball	archives.	To	install	the	plugin,	extract	
the	version	(binary	or	source)	that	you	want	to	use,	and	then	follow	the	instructions	in	the	included	
README.TXT	file.	Perform	the	installation	in	the	directory	where	you	extracted	the	archive.	
For	information	about	supported	versions	of	Maven,	see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	System	
Requirements	document.	
If	you	have	aprevious	version	of	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	installed,	and	then	install	the	latest	version.	
Uninstalling	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	
To	uninstall	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	,manually	delete	all	files	from	the	<maven_	local_	
repo>	/repository/com/fortify/ps/maven/plugin	directory.	
Testing	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	Installation	
After	you	install	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	,use	one	of	the	included	sample	files	to	be	sure	your	
installation	works	properly.	
To	test	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	using	the	Eightball	sample	file:	
1.	Add	the	directory	that	contains	the	sourceanalyzer	executable	to	the	path	environment	
variable.
For	example:	
export	set	PATH=$PATH:/	<sca_	install_	dir>	/bin	
or

set	PATH=%PATH%;	<sca_	install_	dir>	/bin	
2.	Type	sourceanalyzer	-version	to	test	the	path	setting.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	version	information	is	displayed	if	the	path	setting	is	correct.	
3.	Navigate	to	the	sample	Eightball	directory:	<root_	dir>	/samples/EightBall	.	
4.	Type	the	following	command:	
mvn	com.fortify.sca.plugins.maven:sca-	maven-	plugin:	<ver>	:clean	
where	<ver>	is	the	version	of	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	you	are	using.	If	the	version	is	not	
specified,	Maven	uses	the	latest	version	of	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	that	is	installed	in	the	local	
repository.
Note:	To	see	the	version	of	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	,open	the	pom.xml	file	that	you	
extracted	in	<root_	dir>	in	atext	editor.	The	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	version	is	specified	in	the	
<version>	¬†element.	
5.	If	the	command	in	step	4	completed	successfully,	then	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	is	installed	
correctly.	The	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	is	not	installed	correctly	if	you	get	the	following	error	message:	
[ERROR]	Error	resolving	version	for	plugin	
'com.fortify.sca.plugins.maven:sca-	maven-	plugin'	from	the	repositories	
Check	the	Maven	local	repository	and	try	to	install	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	again.	
Using	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	
There	are	two	ways	to	perform	aFortify	analysis	on	amaven	project:	
l	As	aMaven	Plugin	
In	this	method,	you	perform	the	Fortify	analysis	tasks	as	goals	with	the	mvn	command.	For	example,	
the	following	command	is	used	to	translate	source	code:	
mvn	com.fortify.sca.plugins.maven:sca-	maven-	plugin:	<ver>	:translate	
To	analyze	your	code	this	way,	see	the	documentation	included	with	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	.The	
following	table	describes	where	to	find	the	documentation	after	the	Fortify	Maven	Plugin	is	properly	
installed.

-exclude
<file_	specifiers>	
Removes	files	from	the	list	of	files	to	translate.	Separate	multiple	file	
paths	with	semicolons	(Windows)	or	colons	(non-	Windows	systems).	
See	""Specifying	Files	and	Directories""	on	page	¬†123	for	more	
information	on	how	to	use	file	specifiers.	
For	example:	
sourceanalyzer	‚Äìcp	""**/*.jar""	""**/*""	
-exclude¬†""**/Test/*.java""	
This	example	excludes	all	Java	files	in	any	Test	subdirectory.	
Note:	When	you	integrate	the	translation	with	acompiler	or	a	
build	tool,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	all	source	files	
that	the	compiler	or	build	tool	processes	even	if	they	are	specified	
with	this	option.	
Equivalent	Property	Name:	
com.fortify.sca.exclude	
-encoding	<encoding_	
name>	
Specifies	the	source	file	encoding	type.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
enables	you	to	scan	aproject	that	contains	differently	encoded	source	
files.	To	work	with	amulti-	encoded	project,	you	must	specify	the	-	
encoding	option	in	the	translation	phase,	when	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	first	reads	the	source	code	file.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
remembers	this	encoding	in	the	build	session	and	propagates	it	into	
the	FVDL	file.	
Valid	encoding	names	are	from	the	java.nio.charset.Charset	.	
Typically,	if	you	do	not	specify	the	encoding	type,	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	uses	file.encoding	from	the	
java.io.InputStreamReader	constructor	with	no	encoding	
parameter.	In	afew	cases	(for	example	with	the	ActionScript	parser),

-autoheap	Enables	automatic	allocation	of	memory	based	on	the	physical	memory	
available	on	the	system.	This	is	the	default	memory	allocation	setting.	
-Xmx	<size>	M	|G	Specifies	the	maximum	amount	of	memory	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
uses.
Heap	sizes	between	32	¬†GB	and	48	¬†GB	are	not	advised	due	to	internal	JVM	
implementations.	Heap	sizes	in	this	range	perform	worse	than	at	32	GB.	
Heap	sizes	smaller	than	32	¬†GB	are	optimized	by	the	JVM.	If	your	scan	
requires	more	than	32	¬†GB,	then	you	probably	need	64	¬†GB	or	more.	As	a	
guideline,	assuming	no	other	memory	intensive	processes	are	running,	do	
not	allocate	more	than	2/3	of	the	available	memory.	
When	you	specify	this	option,	make	sure	that	you	do	not	allocate	more	
memory	than	is	physically	available,	because	this	degrades	performance.	
As	aguideline,	and	the	assumption	that	no	other	memory	intensive	
processes	are	running,	do	not	allocate	more	than	2/3	of	the	available	
memory.
Note:	Specifying	this	option	overrides	the	default	memory	allocation	
you	would	get	with	the	-autoheap	option.

characters:	asingle	asterisk	character	(*)	matches	part	of	afile	name,	and	double	asterisk	characters	(**)	
recursively	matches	directories.	You	can	specify	one	or	more	files,	one	or	more	file	specifiers,	or	a

You	can	use	the	fortifyupdate	utility	to	download	the	latest	Fortify	Secure	¬†Coding	Rulepacks	and	
metadata	from	the	Fortify	Customer	Portal	for	your	installation.	
The	fortifyupdate	utility	gathers	information	about	the	existing	security	content	in	your	Fortify	
installation	and	contacts	the	update	server	with	this	information.	The	server	returns	new	or	updated	
security	content,	and	removes	any	obsolete	security	content	from	your	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
installation.	If	your	installation	is	current,	amessage	is	displayed	to	that	effect.

Chapter	19:	Improving	Performance	
This	chapter	provides	guidelines	and	tips	to	optimize	memory	usage	and	performance	when	analyzing	
different	types	of	codebases	with	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Hardware	Considerations	142	
Sample	Scans	143	
Tuning	Options	144	
Quick	Scan	145	
Configuring	Scan	Speed	with	Speed	Dial	146	
Breaking	Down	Codebases	147	
Limiting	Analyzers	and	Languages	148	
Optimizing	FPR	¬†Files	149	
Monitoring	Long	Running	Scans	153	
Hardware	Considerations	
The	variety	of	source	code	makes	accurate	predictions	of	memory	usage	and	scan	times	impossible.	The	
factors	that	affect	memory	usage	and	performance	consists	of	many	different	factors	including:	
l	Code	type	
l	Codebase	size	and	complexity	
l	Ancillary	languages	used	(such	as	JSP,	JavaScript,	and	HTML)	
l	Number	of	vulnerabilities	
l	Type	of	vulnerabilities	(analyzer	used)	
Fortify	developed	the	following	set	of	""best	guess""	hardware	recommendations	based	on	real-	world	
application	scan	results.	The	following	table	lists	these	recommendations	based	on	the	complexity	of	the	
application.	In	general,	increasing	the	number	of	available	cores	might	improve	scan	times.

(GB)	Description	
Medium	8	32	A	standalone	system	that	works	with	complex	computer	
models	such	as	atax	calculation	system	or	ascheduling	
system.	
Complex	16	128	A	three-	tiered	business	system	with	transactional	data	
processing	such	as	afinancial	system	or	acommercial	website.	
Very	Complex	32	256	A	system	that	delivers	content	such	as	an	application	server,	
database	server,	or	content	management	system.	
Note:	TypeScript	and	JavaScript	scans	increase	the	analysis	time	significantly.	If	the	total	lines	of	
code	in	an	application	consist	of	more	than	20%	TypeScript	or	JavaScript,	use	the	next	highest	
recommendation.
The	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	System	Requirements	document	describes	the	system	requirements.	
However,	for	large	and	complex	applications,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	requires	more	capable	
hardware.	This	includes:	
l	Disk	I/O	‚Äî	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	is	I/O	intensive	and	therefore	the	faster	the	hard	drive,	the	
more	savings	on	the	I/O	transactions.	Fortify	recommends	a7,200	RPM	drive,	although	a10,000	
RPM	drive	(such	as	the	WD	Raptor)	or	an	SSD	drive	is	better.	
l	Memory	‚Äî	See	""Memory	Tuning""	on	page	¬†157	for	more	information	about	how	to	determine	the	
amount	of	memory	required	for	optimal	performance.	
l	CPU	‚Äî	Fortify	recommends	a2.1	GHz	or	faster	processor.	
Sample	Scans	
These	sample	scans	were	performed	using	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	version	20.2.0	on	dedicated	
virtual	machines.	These	scans	were	run	using	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Content	2020

Quick	Scan	
Quick	scan	mode	provides	away	to	quickly	scan	your	projects	for	critical-	and	high-	priority	issues.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	performs	the	scan	faster	by	reducing	the	depth	of	the	and	applying	the	
Quick	View	filter	set.	Quick	scan	settings	are	configurable.	For	more	details	about	the	configuration	of	
quick	scan	mode,	see	""fortify-	sca-	quickscan.properties""	on	page	¬†211	.	
Quick	scans	are	agreat	way	to	get	many	applications	through	an	assessment	so	that	you	can	quickly	
find	issues	and	begin	remediation.	The	performance	improvement	you	get	depends	on	the	complexity	
and	size	of	the	application.	Although	the	scan	is	faster	than	afull	scan,	it	does	not	provide	as	robust	a	
result	set.	Fortify	recommends	that	you	run	full	scans	whenever	possible.	
Limiters
The	depth	of	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	analysis	sometimes	depends	on	the	available	resources.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	acomplexity	metric	to	trade	off	these	resources	with	the	number	of	
vulnerabilities	that	it	can	find.	Sometimes,	this	means	giving	up	on	aparticular	function	when	it	does	not	
look	like	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	has	enough	resources	available.	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	enables	the	user	to	control	the	‚Äúcutoff‚Äù	point	by	using	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	limiter	properties.	The	different	analyzers	have	different	limiters.	You	can	run	apredefined	set	
of	these	limiters	using	aquick	scan.	See	the	""fortify-	sca-	quickscan.properties""	on	page	¬†211	for	
descriptions	of	the	limiters.	
To	enable	quick	scan	mode,	use	the	-quick	option	with	-scan	option.	With	quick	scan	mode	enabled,	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	applies	the	properties	from	the	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca-	quickscan.properties	file,	in	addition	to	the	standard	
<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	file.	You	can	adjust	the	limiters	
that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	by	editing	the	fortify-	sca-	quickscan.properties	file.	If	
you	modify	fortify-	sca.properties	,it	also	affects	quick	scan	behavior.	Fortify	recommends	that	
User	Guide

you	do	performance	tuning	in	quick	scan	mode,	and	leave	the	full	scan	in	the	default	settings	to	
produce	ahighly	accurate	scan.	For	description	of	the	quick	scan	mode	properties,	see	""Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	Properties	Files""	on	page	¬†180	.	
Using	Quick	Scan	and	Full	Scan	
l	Run	full	scans	periodically	‚Äî	A	periodic	full	scan	is	important	as	it	might	find	issues	that	quick	scan	
mode	does	not	detect.	Run	afull	scan	at	least	once	per	software	iteration.	If	possible,	run	afull	scan	
periodically	when	it	will	not	interrupt	the	development	workflow,	such	as	on	aweekend.	
l	Compare	quick	scan	with	a	full	scan	‚Äî	To	evaluate	the	accuracy	impact	of	aquick	scan,	perform	a	
quick	scan	and	afull	scan	on	the	same	codebase.	Open	the	quick	scan	results	in	Micro	Focus	Fortify	
Audit	Workbench	and	merge	it	into	the	full	scan.	Group	the	issues	by	New	Issue	to	produce	alist	of	
issues	detected	in	the	full	scan	but	not	in	the	quick	scan.	
l	Quick	scans	and	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	server	‚Äî	To	avoid	overwriting	
the	results	of	afull	scan,	by	default	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	ignores	uploaded	FPR	files	
scanned	in	quick	scan	mode.	However,	you	can	configure	aFortify	Software	Security	Center	
application	version	so	that	FPR	¬†files	scanned	in	quick	scan	are	processed.	For	more	information,	see	
analysis	results	processing	rules	in	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	User	Guide	.	
Configuring	Scan	Speed	with	Speed	Dial	
The	speed	dial	feature	is	available	in	this	release	as	atechnology	preview.	You	can	configure	the	speed	
and	depth	of	the	scan	by	specifying	aprecision	level	for	the	scan	phase.	You	can	use	these	precision	
levels	adjust	the	scan	time	to	fit	for	example,	into	apipeline	and	quickly	find	aset	of	vulnerabilities	while	
the	developer	is	still	working	on	the	code.	Although	scans	with	the	speed	dial	settings	are	faster	than	a	
full	scan,	it	does	not	provide	as	robust	aresult	set.	Fortify	recommends	that	you	run	full	scans	whenever	
possible.
The	precision	level	controls	the	depth	and	precision	of	the	scan	by	associating	configuration	properties	
with	each	level.	The	configuration	properties	files	for	each	level	are	located	in	the	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Core/config/scales	directory.	There	is	one	file	for	each	level:	(level-	<precision_	
level>	.properties	).	You	can	modify	the	settings	in	these	files	to	create	your	own	specific	precision	
levels.
Important!	As	this	feature	is	atechnology	preview,	be	aware	that	if	you	modify	the	configuration	
files	they	might	be	overwritten	with	an	upgrade	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.	
Notes:
l	By	default,	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	blocks	uploaded	scans	performed	with	
aprecision	level.	However,	you	can	configure	your	Fortify	Software	Security	Center	application	
version	so	that	uploaded	audit	projects	scanned	with	these	precision	levels	are	processed.	
l	If	you	merge	aspeed	dial	scan	with	afull	scan,	this	might	remove	issues	from	previous	scans	that	
still	exist	in	your	application	(and	would	be	detected	again	with	afull	scan).	
User	Guide	
Chapter	19:	Improving	Performance	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	146	of	216 

To	specify	the	speed	dial	setting	for	ascan,	include	the	-scan-	precision	(or	-p)¬†option	in	the	scan	
phase	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-scan-	precision	<level>	-f	
myresults.fpr
Note:	You	cannot	use	the	speed	dial	setting	and	the	-quick	option	in	the	same	scan	command.	
The	following	table	describes	the	two	precision	levels.	
Precision
Level	Description	
1	This	is	the	quickest	scan	and	is	recommended	if	you	are	scanning	afew	files.	By	default,	a	
scan	with	this	precision	level	disables	the	Buffer	Analyzer,	Control	Flow	Analyzer,	
Dataflow	Analyzer,	and	Null	Pointer	Analyzer.	
2	By	default,	ascan	with	this	precision	level	enables	all	analyzers.	The	scan	runs	quicker	by	
performing	with	reduced	limiters.	This	results	in	fewer	issues	detected.	
You	can	also	specify	the	scan	precision	level	with	the	com.fortify.sca.PrecisionLevel	property	
in	the	fortify-	sca.properties	file.	For	example:	
com.fortify.sca.PrecisionLevel=1
Breaking	Down	Codebases	
It	is	more	efficient	to	break	down	large	projects	into	independent	modules.	For	example,	if	you	have	a	
portal	application	that	consists	of	several	modules	that	are	independent	of	each	other	or	have	very	little	
interactions,	you	can	translate	and	scan	the	modules	separately.	The	caveat	to	this	is	that	you	might	
lose	dataflow	issue	detection	if	some	interactions	exist.	
For	C/C++,	you	might	reduce	the	scan	time	by	using	the	‚Äìbin	option	with	the	‚Äìscan	option.	You	need	
to	pass	the	binary	file	as	the	parameter	(such	as	-bin	<filename>	.exe	-scan	or	-bin	
<filename>	.dll	-scan	).	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	finds	the	related	files	associated	with	the	
binary	and	scans	them.	This	is	useful	if	you	have	several	binaries	in	amakefile.	
User	Guide	
Chapter	19:	Improving	Performance	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	147	of	216 

The	following	table	lists	some	useful	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	command-	line	options	to	break	down	
codebases.
Option	Description	
-bin	<binary>	Specifies	asubset	of	source	files	to	scan.	Only	the	source	files	that	were	
linked	in	the	named	binary	at	build	time	are	included	in	the	scan.	You	can	
use	this	option	multiple	times	to	specify	the	inclusion	of	multiple	binaries	
in	the	scan.	
-show-	binaries	Displays	all	objects	that	were	created	but	not	used	in	the	production	of	
any	other	binaries.	If	fully	integrated	into	the	build,	it	lists	all	of	the	
binaries	produced.	
-show-	build-	tree	When	used	with	the	-bin	option,	displays	all	files	used	to	create	the	
binary	and	all	files	used	to	create	those	files	in	atree	layout.	If	the	-bin	
option	is	not	present,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	displays	the	tree	for	
each	binary.	
Limiting	Analyzers	and	Languages	
Occasionally,	you	might	find	that	asignificant	amount	of	the	scan	time	is	spent	either	running	one	
particular	analyzer	or	analyzing	aparticular	language.	It	is	possible	that	this	particular	analyzer	or	
language	is	not	important	to	your	security	requirements.	You	can	limit	the	specific	analyzers	that	run	
and	the	specific	languages	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates.	
Disabling	Analyzers	
To	disable	specific	analyzers,	include	the	-analyzers	option	to	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	at	scan	
time	with	acolon-	or	comma-	separated	list	of	analyzers	you	want	to	enable.	The	full	list	of	analyzers	is:	
buffer	,content	,configuration	,controlflow	,dataflow	,findbugs	,nullptr	,semantic	,and	
structural	.	
For	example,	to	run	ascan	that	only	includes	the	Dataflow,	Control	Flow,	and	Buffer	analyzers,	use	the	
following	scan	command:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-analyzers	dataflow:controlflow:buffer	-scan	
-f	myresults.fpr	
You	can	also	do	the	same	thing	by	setting	com.fortify.sca.DefaultAnalyzers	in	the	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	property	file	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify-

Disabling	Languages	
To	disable	specific	languages,	include	the	-disable-	language	option	in	the	translation	phase,	which	
specifies	alist	of	languages	that	you	want	to	exclude.	The	full	list	of	valid	language	parameters	is:	
abap,	actionscript,	apex,	cfml,	cpp,	cobol,	configuration,	dotnet,	java,	
javascript,	jsp,	objc,	php,	plsql,	python,	ruby,	scala,	sql,	swift,	tsql,	
typescript,	vb	
For	example,	to	perform	atranslation	that	excludes	SQL	and	PHP	files,	use	the	following	command:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	<src_	files>	-disable-	language	sql:php	
You	can	also	disable	languages	by	setting	the	com.fortify.sca.DISabledLanguages	property	in	
the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	properties	file	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	
sca.properties	.For	example,	to	achieve	the	equivalent	of	the	previous	translation	command,	set	the	
following	in	the	properties	file:

Optimizing	FPR	¬†Files	
This	chapter	describes	how	to	handle	performance	issues	related	to	the	audit	results	(FPR)	file.	This	
includes	reducing	the	scan	time,	reducing	FPR	¬†file	size,	and	tips	for	opening	large	FPR	files.	
Filter	Files	
Filter	files	are	flat	files	that	you	can	specify	with	ascan	using	the	-filter	option.	Use	afilter	file	to	filter	
out	particular	vulnerability	instances,	rules,	and	vulnerability	categories.	If	you	determine	that	acertain	
issue	category	or	rule	is	not	relevant	for	aparticular	scan,	you	can	stop	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
from	flagging	these	types	of	issues	and	adding	them	to	the	FPR.	Using	afilter	file	can	reduce	both	the	
scan	time	and	results	file	size.	
For	example,	if	you	are	scanning	asimple	program	that	just	reads	aspecified	file,	you	might	not	want	to	
see	path	manipulation	issues,	because	these	are	likely	planned	as	part	of	the	functionality.	To	filter	out	
path	manipulation	issues,	create	afile	that	contains	asingle	line:	
Path	Manipulation	
Save	this	file	as	filter.txt	.Use	the	-filter	option	for	the	scan	as	shown	in	the	following	example:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-f	myresults.fpr	-filter	filter.txt	
The	myresults.fpr	does	not	include	any	issues	with	the	category	Path	Manipulation.	
For	more	information	about	filter	files,	see	""Filtering	the	Analysis""	on	page	¬†165	.

Excluding	Issues	from	the	FPR	¬†with	Filter	Sets	
Filters	in	an	issue	template	determine	how	the	results	from	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	are	shown.	For	
example,	you	can	have	afilter	to	put	any	detected	SQL	Injection	issues	into	aseparate	folder	called	SQL	
Injections	,or	you	might	have	afilter	that	hides	issues	with	aconfidence	below	acertain	threshold.	In	
addition	to	filters,	filter	sets	enable	you	to	have	aselection	of	filters	used	at	any	one	time.	Each	FPR	has	
an	issue	template	associated	with	it.	You	can	use	filter	sets	to	reduce	the	number	of	issues	based	on	
conditions	you	specify	with	filters	in	an	issue	template.	This	can	dramatically	reduce	the	size	of	an	FPR.	
To	do	this,	use	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	to	create	afilter	and	afilter	set	and	then	run	the	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	scan	with	the	filter	set.	For	more	detailed	instructions	about	how	to	create	
filters	and	filter	sets	in	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	,see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	User	
Guide	.The	following	example	describes	the	basic	steps	for	how	to	create	and	use	ascan-	time	filter:	
1.	In	this	example,	suppose	you	use	OWASP	Top	10	2017	and	you	only	want	to	see	issues	
categorized	within	this	standard.	Create	afilter	in	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	such	as:	
If	[OWASP	Top	10	2017]	does	not	contain	A	Then	hide	issue	
This	filter	looks	through	the	issues	and	if	an	issue	does	not	map	to	an	OWASP	Top	10	2017	
category	with	‚ÄòA‚Äô	in	the	name,	then	it	hides	it.	Because	all	OWASP	Top	10	2017	categories	start	
with	‚ÄòA‚Äô	(A1,	A2,	‚Ä¶,	A10),	then	any	category	without	the	letter	‚ÄòA‚Äô	is	not	in	the	OWASP	Top	10	
2017.	The	filter	hides	the	issues	from	view	in	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	,but	they	are	still	in	the	FPR.	
2.	In	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	,create	anew	filter	set	called	OWASP_	Filter_	Set	that	contains	the	
previous	filter,	and	then	export	the	issue	template	to	afile	called	IssueTemplate.xml	.	
3.	You	can	then	specify	this	filter	at	scan-time	with	the	following	command:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-scan	-f	myFilteredResults.fpr	
-project-	template	IssueTemplate.xml	-Dcom.fortify.sca.FilterSet=OWASP_	
Filter_	set	
In	the	previous	example,	the	inclusion	of	the	-Dcom.fortify.sca.FilterSet	property	tells	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	to	use	the	OWASP_	Filter_	Set	filter	set	from	the	issue	template	
IssueTemplate.xml	.Any	filters	that	hide	issues	from	view	are	removed	and	are	not	written	to	the	
FPR.	Therefore,	you	can	reduce	the	visible	number	of	issues,	make	the	scan	very	targeted,	and	reduce	
the	size	of	the	resulting	FPR	file.	
Note:	Although	filtering	issues	with	afilter	set	can	reduce	the	size	of	the	FPR,	they	do	not	usually	
reduce	the	scan	time.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	examines	¬†the	filter	set	after	it	calculates	the	
issues	to	determine	whether	to	write	them	to	the	FPR	file.	The	filters	in	afilter	set	determine	the	
rule	types	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	loads.	
Excluding	Source	Code	from	the	FPR	
You	can	reduce	the	scan	time	and	the	size	of	the	FPR	¬†file	by	excluding	the	source	code	information	
from	the	FPR.	This	is	especially	valuable	for	large	source	files	or	codebases.	You	do	not	generally	get	a

scan	time	reduction	for	small	source	files.	
There	are	two	ways	to	prevent	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	from	including	source	code	in	the	FPR.	You	
can	set	the	property	in	the	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	file	or	
specify	an	option	on	the	command	line.	The	following	table	describes	these	settings.	
Property	Name	Description	
com.fortify.sca.
FPRDisableSourceBundling=true
Command-	Line	Option:	
-disable-	source-	bundling	
This	excludes	source	code	from	the	FPR.	
com.fortify.sca.
FVDLDisableSnippets=true
Command-	Line	Option:	
‚Äìfvdl-	no-	snippets	
This	excludes	code	snippets	from	the	FPR.	
The	following	command-	line	example	uses	both	options:	
sourceanalyzer	-b	<build_	id>	-disable-	source-	bundling	
-fvdl-	no-	snippets	-scan	-f	mySourcelessResults.fpr	
Reducing	the	FPR	¬†File	Size	
There	are	afew	ways	to	reduce	the	size	of	FPR	files.	The	quickest	way	to	do	this	without	affecting	
results	is	to	exclude	the	source	code	from	the	FPR	as	described	in	""Excluding	Source	Code	from	the	
FPR""	on	the	previous	page	.	
There	are	afew	other	options	and	properties	that	you	can	use	to	select	what	is	excluded	from	the	FPR.	
You	can	set	these	properties	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	properties	file:	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	or	specify	them	during	the	scan	phase	with	-

property	typically	only	has	aminimal	effect	on	the	
overall	size	of	the	FPR	file.	
Opening	Large	FPR	¬†Files	
To	reduce	the	time	required	to	open	alarge	FPR	file,	there	are	some	properties	that	you	can	set	in	the	
<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify.properties	configuration	file.	For	more	
information	about	these	properties,	see	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	Tools	Properties	
Reference	Guide	.The	following	table	describes	these	properties.	
Property	Name	Description	
com.fortify.

com.fortify.
model.IssueCutOffStartIndex
=<num>	(inclusive)	
com.fortify.
model.IssueCutOffEndIndex
=<num>	(exclusive)	
The	IssueCutOffStartIndex	property	is	
inclusive	and	IssueCutOffEndIndex	is	
exclusive	so	that	you	can	specify	asubset	of	
issues	you	want	to	see.	For	example,	to	see	the	
first	100	issues,	specify	the	following:	
User	Guide	
Chapter	19:	Improving	Performance

Property	Name	Description
com.fortify.model.
IssueCutOffStartIndex=0
com.fortify.model.
IssueCutOffEndIndex=101
Because	the	IssueCutOffStartIndex	is	0	by	
default,	you	do	not	need	to	specify	this	
property.	
com.fortify.
model.IssueCutOffByCategoryStartIndex=
<num>	(inclusive)	
com.fortify.
model.IssueCutOffByCategoryEndIndex=
<num>	(exclusive)	
These	two	properties	are	similar	to	the	previous	
cutoff	properties	except	these	are	specified	for	
each	category.	For	example,	to	see	the	first	five	
issues	for	every	category,	specify	the	following:	
com.fortify.model.
IssueCutOffByCategoryEndIndex=6	
com.fortify.
model.MinimalLoad=true	
This	minimizes	the	data	loaded	in	the	FPR.	This	
also	restricts	usage	of	the	Functions	view	and	
might	prevent	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	from	
loading	the	source	from	the	FPR.	
com.fortify.
model.MaxEngineErrorCount=
<num>	
This	property	specifies	the	number	of	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	reported	warnings	that	
are	loaded	with	the	FPR.	For	projects	with	a	
large	number	of	scan	warnings,	this	can	reduce	
both	load	time	in	Fortify	Audit	Workbench	and	
the	amount	of	memory	required	to	open	the	
FPR.	
com.fortify.
model.ExecMemorySetting	
Specifies	the	JVM	heap	memory	size	for	Audit	
Workbench	to	launch	external	utilities	such	as	
iidmigrator	and	fortifyupdate.	
Monitoring	Long	Running	Scans	
When	you	run	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,large	and	complex	scans	can	often	take	along	time	to	
complete.	During	the	scan	it	is	not	always	clear	what	is	happening.	While	Fortify	recommends	that	you	
provide	your	debug	logs	to	the	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Customer	Support	team,	there	are	acouple	of	ways	
to	see	what	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	is	doing	and	how	it	is	performing	in	real-	time.

Using	the	SCAState	Utility	
The	SCAState	command-	line	utility	enables	you	to	see	up-	to-	date	state	analysis	information	during	the	
analysis	phase.	The	SCAState	utility	is	located	in	the	<sca_	install_	dir>	/bin	directory.	In	addition	
to	alive	view	of	the	analysis,	it	also	provides	aset	of	timers	and	counters	that	show	where	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	spends	its	time	during	the	scan.	For	more	information	about	how	to	use	the	SCAState	
utility,	see	the	""Checking	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	Scan	Status""	on	page¬†139	.	
Using	JMX	Tools	
You	can	use	tools	to	monitor	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	with	JMX	technology.	These	tools	can	
provide	away	to	track	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	performance	over	time.	For	more	information	about	
these	tools,	see	the	full	Oracle	documentation	available	at:	¬†http://docs.oracle.com	.	
Note:	These	are	third-	party	tools	and	Micro	Focus	does	not	provide	or	support	them.	
Using	JConsole	
JConsole	is	an	interactive	monitoring	tool	that	complies	with	the	JMX	specification.	The	disadvantage	of	
JConsole	is	that	you	cannot	save	the	output.	
To	use	JConsole,	you	must	first	set	some	additional	JVM	parameters.	Set	the	following	environment	
variable:
export	SCA_	VM_	OPTS=""-	Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote	
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9090
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false""	
After	the	JMX	parameters	are	set,	start	aFortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	scan.	During	the	scan,	start	
JConsole	to	monitor	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	locally	or	remotely	with	the	following	command:	
jconsole	<host_	name>	:9090	
Using	Java	VisualVM	
Java	VisualVM	offers	the	same	capabilities	as	JConsole.	It	also	provides	more	detailed	information	on	
the	JVM	and	enables	you	to	save	the	monitor	information	to	an	application	snapshot	file.	You	can	store	
these	files	and	open	them	later	with	Java	VisualVM.	
Similar	to	JConsole,	before	you	can	use	Java	VisualVM,	you	must	set	the	same	JVM	parameters	
described	in	""Using	JConsole""	above	.

You	can	extend	the	default	exit	code	options	by	setting	the	com.fortify.sca.ExitCodeLevel	
property	in	the	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/Config/fortify-	sca.properties	file.	
The	valid	values	are:	
l	nothing	‚Äî	Returns	exit	codes	0,	1,	2,	or	3.	This	is	the	default	setting.	
l	warnings	‚Äî	Returns	exit	codes	0,	1,	2,	3,	4,	or	5.

l	no_	output_	file	‚Äî	Returns	exit	codes	0,	1,	2,	3,	or	6.	
Memory	Tuning	
The	amount	of	physical	RAM	required	for	ascan	depends	on	the	complexity	of	the	code.	By	default,	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	automatically	allocates	the	memory	it	uses	based	on	the	physical	memory	
available	on	the	system.	This	is	generally	sufficient.	As	described	in	""Output	Options""	on	page	¬†117	,you	
can	adjust	the	Java	heap	size	with	the	-Xmx	command-	line	option.	
This	section	describes	suggestions	for	what	you	can	do	if	you	encounter	OutOfMemory	errors	during	
the	analysis.	
Note:	You	can	set	the	memory	allocation	options	discussed	in	this	section	to	run	for	all	scans	by	
setting	the	SCA_	VM_	OPTS	environment	variable.	
Java	Heap	Exhaustion	
Java	heap	exhaustion	is	the	most	common	memory	problem	that	might	occur	during	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	scans.	It	is	caused	by	allocating	too	little	heap	space	to	the	Java	virtual	machine	that	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	to	scan	the	code.	You	can	identify	Java	heap	exhaustion	from	the	following	
symptom.
Symptom
One	or	more	of	these	messages	appears	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	log	file	and	in	the	
command-	line	output:	
There	is	not	enough	memory	available	to	complete	analysis.	For	details	on	
making	more	memory	available,	please	consult	the	user	manual.	
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:	Java	heap	space	
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:	GC	overhead	limit	exceeded	
Resolution
To	resolve	aJava	heap	exhaustion	problem,	allocate	more	heap	space	to	the	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	Java	virtual	machine	when	you	start	the	scan.	To	increase	the	heap	size,	use	the	-Xmx	
command-	line	option	when	you	run	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	scan.	For	example,	-Xmx1G	makes	
1	GB	available.	Before	you	use	this	parameter,	determine	the	maximum	allowable	value	for	Java	heap	
space.	The	maximum	value	depends	on	the	available	physical	memory.	
User	Guide	
Chapter	20:	Troubleshooting	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	157	of	216 

Heap	sizes	between	32	¬†GB	and	48	¬†GB	are	not	advised	due	to	internal	JVM	implementations.	Heap	sizes	
in	this	range	perform	worse	than	at	32	¬†GB.	Heap	sizes	smaller	than	32	¬†GB	are	optimized	by	the	JVM.	If	
your	scan	requires	more	than	32	¬†GB,	then	you	probably	need	64	¬†GB	or	more.	As	aguideline,	assuming	
no	other	memory	intensive	processes	are	running,	do	not	allocate	more	than	2/3	of	the	available	
memory.
If	the	system	is	dedicated	to	running	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	,you	do	not	need	to	change	it.	
However,	if	the	system	resources	are	shared	with	other	memory-intensive	processes,	subtract	an	
allowance	for	those	other	processes.	
Note:	You	do	not	need	to	account	for	other	resident	but	not	active	processes	(while	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	is	running)	¬†that	the	operating	system	might	swap	to	disk.	Allocating	more	physical	
memory	to	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	than	is	available	in	the	environment	might	cause	
‚Äúthrashing,‚Äù	which	typically	slows	down	the	scan	along	with	everything	else	on	the	system.	
Native	Heap	Exhaustion	
Native	heap	exhaustion	is	arare	scenario	where	the	Java	virtual	machine	can	allocate	the	Java	memory	
regions	on	startup,	but	is	left	with	so	few	resources	for	its	native	operations	(such	as	garbage	collection)	
that	it	eventually	encounters	afatal	memory	allocation	failure	that	immediately	terminates	the	process.	
Symptom
You	can	identify	native	heap	exhaustion	by	abnormal	termination	of	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	
process	and	the	following	output	on	the	command	line:	
#	A	fatal	error	has	been	detected	by	the	Java	Runtime	Environment:	
#
#	java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:	requested	...	bytes	for	GrET	...	
Because	this	is	afatal	Java	virtual	machine	error,	it	is	usually	accompanied	by	an	error	log	created	in	the	
working	directory	with	the	file	name	¬†hs_	err_	pidNNN.log	.	
Resolution
Because	the	problem	is	aresult	of	overcrowding	within	the	process,	the	resolution	is	to	reduce	the	
amount	of	memory	used	for	the	Java	memory	regions	(Java	heap).	Reducing	this	value	should	reduce	
the	crowding	problem	and	allow	the	scan	to	complete	successfully.	
Stack	Overflow	
Each	thread	in	aJava	application	has	its	own	stack.	The	stack	holds	return	addresses,	function/method	
call	arguments,	and	so	on.	If	athread	tends	to	process	large	structures	with	recursive	algorithms,	it	
might	need	alarge	stack	for	all	those	return	addresses.	With	the	JVM,	you	can	set	that	size	with	the	-	
Xss	option.	
Symptoms
This	message	typically	appears	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	log	file,	but	might	also	appear	in	the	
command-	line	output:

java.lang.StackOverflowError
Resolution
The	default	stack	size	is	16	MB.	To	increase	the	stack	size,	pass	the	-Xss	option	to	the	
sourceanalyzer	command.	For	example,	-Xss32M	increases	the	stack	to	32	MB.	
Scanning	Complex	Functions	
During	aFortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	scan,	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	might	encounter	afunction	for	
which	it	cannot	complete	the	analysis	and	reports	the	following	message:	
Function	<name>	is	too	complex	for	<analyzer>	analysis	and	will	be	skipped	
(<identifier>	)	
where:
l	<name>	is	the	name	of	the	source	code	function	
l	<analyzer>	is	the	name	of	the	analyzer	
l	<identifier>	is	the	type	of	complexity,	which	is	one	of	the	following:	
l	l:Too	many	distinct	locations	
l	m:Out	of	memory	
l	s:Stack	size	too	small	
l	t:Analysis	taking	too	much	time	
l	v:Function	visits	exceed	the	limit	
The	depth	of	analysis	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	performs	sometimes	depends	on	the	available	
resources.	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	acomplexity	metric	to	tradeoff	these	resources	against	the	
number	of	vulnerabilities	that	it	can	find.	Sometimes,	this	means	giving	up	on	aparticular	function	when	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	does	not	have	enough	resources	available.	This	is	normally	when	you	see	
the	""Function	too	complex""	messages.	
When	you	see	this	message,	it	does	not	necessarily	mean	that	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	completely	
ignored	the	function	in	the	program.	For	example,	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	typically	visits	afunction	
many	times	before	completing	the	analysis,	and	might	not	have	run	into	this	complexity	limit	in	the	
previous	visits.	In	this	case,	the	results	include	anything	learned	from	the	previous	visits.	
You	can	control	the	""give	up""	point	using	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	properties	called	limiters.	
Different	analyzers	have	different	limiters.	
The	following	sections	provide	adiscussion	of	aresolution	for	this	issue.

Dataflow	Analyzer	Limiters	
There	are	three	types	of	complexity	identifiers	for	the	Dataflow	Analyzer:	
l	l:Too	many	distinct	locations	
l	m:Out	of	memory	
l	s:Stack	size	too	small	
l	v:Function	visits	exceed	the	limit	
To	resolve	the	issue	identified	by	s,increase	the	stack	size	for	by	setting	-Xss	¬†to	avalue	greater	than	
16	¬†MB.	
To	resolve	the	complexity	identifier	of	m,increase	the	physical	memory	for	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.	
To	resolve	the	complexity	identifier	of	l,you	can	adjust	the	following	limiters	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	property	file	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	or	on	the	
command	line.	
Property	Name	Default	Value	
com.fortify.sca.
limiters.MaxTaintDefForVar	
1000	
com.fortify.sca.
limiters.MaxTaintDefForVarAbort	
4000	
com.fortify.sca.
limiters.MaxFieldDepth	
4	
The	MaxTaintDefForVar	limiter	is	adimensionless	value	expressing	the	complexity	of	afunction,	
while	MaxTaintDefForVarAbort	is	the	upper	bound	for	it.	Use	the	MaxFieldDepth	limiter	to	
measure	the	precision	when	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	analyzes	any	given	object.	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	always	tries	to	analyze	objects	at	the	highest	precision	possible.	
If	agiven	function	exceeds	the	¬†MaxTaintDefForVar	limit	at	agiven	precision,	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	
analyzes	that	function	with	lower	precision	(by	reducing	the	¬†MaxFieldDepth	limiter).	¬†When	you	reduce	
the	precision,	it	reduces	the	complexity	of	the	analysis.	When	the	precision	cannot	be	reduced	any	
further,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	then	proceeds	with	analysis	at	the	lowest	precision	until	either	it	
finishes,	or	the	complexity	exceeds	the	¬†MaxTaintDefForVarAbort	limiter.	In	other	words,	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	tries	harder	at	the	lowest	precision	to	get	at	least	some	results	from	the	function.	
If	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	reaches	the	¬†MaxTaintDefForVarAbort	limiter,	it	gives	up	on	the	
function	entirely	and	you	get	the	""Function	too	complex""	warning.	
To	resolve	the	complexity	identifier	of	v,you	can	adjust	the	property	
com.fortify.sca.limiters.MaxFunctionVisits	.This	property	sets	the	maximum	number	of	
times	the	taint	propagation	analyzer	visits	functions.	The	default	is	50	.

Chapter	20:	Troubleshooting	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	160	of	216 

Control	Flow	and	Null	Pointer	Analyzer	Limiters	
There	are	two	types	of	complexity	identifiers	for	both	Control	Flow	and	Null	Pointer	analyzers:	
l	m:Out	of	memory	
l	t:Analysis	taking	too	much	time	
Due	to	the	way	that	the	Dataflow	Analyzer	handles	function	complexity,	it	does	not	take	an	indefinite	
amount	of	time.	Control	Flow	and	Null	Pointer	analyzers,	however,	can	take	avery	long	time	when	
analyzing	very	complex	functions.	Therefore,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	provides	away	to	abort	the	
analysis	when	this	happens,	and	then	you	get	the	""Function	too	complex""	message	with	acomplexity	
identifier	of	t.	
To	change	the	maximum	amount	of	time	these	analyzers	spend	to	analyze	functions,	you	can	adjust	the	
following	property	values	in	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	property	file	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Core/config/fortify-	sca.properties	or	on	the	command	line.	
Property	Name	Description	
Default
Value	
com.fortify.sca.
CtrlflowMaxFunctionTime	
Sets	the	time	limit	(in	milliseconds)	for	Control	Flow	
analysis	on	asingle	function.	
600000
(10	¬†minutes)	
com.fortify.sca.
NullPtrMaxFunctionTime	
Sets	the	time	limit	(in	milliseconds)	for	Null	Pointer	
analysis	on	asingle	function.	
300000
(5	¬†minutes)	
To	resolve	the	complexity	identifier	of	m,increase	the	physical	memory	for	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	.	
Note:	If	you	increase	these	limiters	or	time	settings,	it	makes	the	analysis	of	complex	functions	take	
longer.	It	is	difficult	to	characterize	the	exact	performance	implications	of	aparticular	value	for	the	
limiters/time,	because	it	depends	on	the	specific	function	in	question.	If	you	never	want	to	see	the	
""Function	too	complex""	warning,	you	can	set	the	limiters/time	to	an	extremely	high	value,	however	it	
can	cause	unacceptable	scan	time.	
Issue	Non-	Determinism	
Running	in	parallel	analysis	mode	might	introduce	issue	non-	determinism.	If	you	experience	any	
problems,	contact	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Customer	Support	and	disable	parallel	analysis	mode.	Disabling	
parallel	analysis	mode	results	in	sequential	analysis,	which	can	be	substantially	slower	but	provides	
deterministic	results	across	multiple	scans.	
To	disable	parallel	analysis	mode:	
1.	Open	the	fortify-	sca.properties	file	located	in	the	<sca_	install_	dir>	/core/config	
directory	in	atext	editor.	
User	Guide	
Chapter	20:	Troubleshooting

2.	Change	the	value	for	the	com.fortify.sca.MultithreadedAnalysis	property	to	false	.	
com.fortify.sca.MultithreadedAnalysis=false	
Accessing	Log	Files	
By	default,	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	creates	two	log	files	in	the	following	location:	
l	On	Windows:	C:\Users\	<user>	\AppData\Local\Fortify\sca	<version>	\log	
l	On	other	platforms:	$HOME/.fortify/sca	<version>	/log	
where	<version>	is	the	version	of	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	that	you	are	using.	
The	following	table	describes	the	two	log	files.	
Default	File	Name	Description	
sca.log	The	standard	log	provides	alog	of	informational	messages,	
warnings,	and	errors	that	occurred	in	the	run	of

sca_	FortifySupport.log	The	Fortify	Support	log	provides:	
l	The	same	log	messages	as	the	standard	log	file,	but	with	
additional	details	
l	Additional	detailed	messages	that	are	not	included	in	the	
standard	log	file	
This	log	file	is	only	helpful	to	Micro	Focus	Fortify	Customer	
Support	or	the	development	team	to	troubleshoot	any	
possible	issues.	
If	you	encounter	warnings	or	errors	that	you	cannot	resolve,	provide	the	Fortify	Support	log	file	to

Appendix	A:	Filtering	the	Analysis	
This	section	contains	the	following	topics:	
Filter	Files	165	
Filter	File	Example	165	
Filter	Files	
You	can	create	afile	to	filter	out	particular	vulnerability	instances,	rules,	and	vulnerability	categories	
when	you	run	the	sourceanalyzer	command.	You	specify	the	file	with	the	-filter	analysis	option.	
Note:	Fortify	recommends	that	you	only	use	filter	files	if	you	are	an	advanced	user.	Do	not	use	
filter	files	for	standard	audits,	because	auditors	typically	want	to	see	and	evaluate	all	issues	that	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	finds.	
A	filter	file	is	atext	file	that	you	can	create	with	any	text	editor.	You	specify	only	the	filter	items	that	you	
do	not	want	in	this	file.	Each	filter	item	is	on	aseparate	line	in	the	filter	file.	You	can	specify	the	following	
filter	types:	
l	Category	
l	Instance	ID	
l	Rule	ID	
The	filters	are	applied	at	different	times	in	the	analysis	process,	based	on	the	type	of	filter.	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	applies	category	and	rule	ID	filters	in	the	initialization	phase	before	any	analysis	has	
taken	place,	whereas	an	instance	ID	filter	is	applied	after	the	analysis	phase.

Appendix	D:	Fortify	Java	Annotations	
Fortify	provides	two	versions	of	the	Java	Fortify	annotations	library.	
l	Annotations	with	the	retention	policy	set	to	CLASS	(FortifyAnnotations-	CLASS.jar	).	
With	this	version	of	the	library,	Fortify	annotations	are	propagated	to	the	bytecode	during	
compilation.	
l	Annotations	with	the	retention	policy	set	to	SOURCE	(FortifyAnnotations-	SOURCE.jar	).	
With	this	version	of	the	library,	Fortify	annotations	are	not	propagated	to	the	bytecode	after	the	
code	that	uses	them	is	compiled.	
If	you	use	Fortify	products	to	analyze	bytecode	of	your	applications	(for	example,	with	Fortify	on	
Demand	assessments),	then	use	the	version	with	the	annotation	retention	policy	set	to	CLASS.	If	you	
use	Fortify	products	to	analyze	the	source	code	of	your	applications,	you	can	use	either	version	of	the	
library,	however	Fortify	strongly	recommends	that	you	use	the	library	with	retention	policy	set	to	
SOURCE.
Important!	Leaving	Fortify	annotations	in	production	code	is	asecurity	risk	because	they	can	leak	
information	about	potential	security	problems	in	the	code.	Fortify	recommends	that	you	use	
annotations	with	the	retention	policy	set	to	CLASS	only	for	internal	Fortify	analysis,	and	never	use	
them	in	your	application	production	builds.	
This	section	outlines	the	annotations	available.	A	sample	application	is	included	with	the	Fortify	SCA	
and	Applications	samples	installation	¬†in	the	<sca_	install_	
dir>	/Samples/advanced/javaAnnotations	directory.	A	README.txt	file	included	in	the	directory	
describes	the	sample	application,	problems	that	might	arise	from	it,	and	how	to	fix	these	problems	using	
the	Fortify	Java	Annotations.	
There	are	two	limitations	with	Fortify	Java	annotations:	
l	Each	annotation	can	specify	only	one	input	and/or	one	output.	
l	You	can	apply	only	one	annotation	of	each	type	to	the	same	target.	
Fortify	provides	three	main	types	of	annotations:	
l	""Dataflow	Annotations""	below	
l	""Field	and	Variable	Annotations""	on	page	¬†178	
l	""Other	Annotations""	on	page	¬†179	
You	also	can	write	rules	to	support	your	own	custom	annotations.	Contact	Micro	Focus	Fortify	
Customer	Support	for	more	information.	
Dataflow	Annotations	
There	are	four	types	of	Dataflow	annotations,	similar	to	Dataflow	rules:	Source,	Sink,	Passthrough,	and	
Validate.	All	are	applied	to	methods	and	specify	the	inputs	and/or	outputs	by	parameter	name	or	the	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	175	of	216 

strings	this	and	return	.Additionally,	you	can	apply	the	Dataflow	Source	and	Sink	annotations	to	the	
function	arguments.	
Source	Annotations	
The	acceptable	values	for	the	annotation	parameter	are	this	,return	,or	afunction	parameter	name.	
For	example,	you	can	assign	taint	to	an	output	of	the	target	method.	
@FortifyDatabaseSource	(""return""	)	
String	[]	loadUserProfile	(String	userID	)	{	
...
}	
For	example,	you	can	assign	taint	to	an	argument	of	the	target	method.	
void	retrieveAuthCode	(@FortifyPrivateSource	String	authCode	)	{	
...
}	
In	addition	to	specific	source	annotations,	Fortify	provides	ageneric	untrusted	taint	source	called	
FortifySource	.	
The	following	is	acomplete	list	of	source	annotations:	
l	FortifySource	
l	FortifyDatabaseSource	
l	FortifyFileSystemSource	
l	FortifyNetworkSource	
l	FortifyPCISource	
l	FortifyPrivateSource	
l	FortifyWebSource	
Passthrough	Annotations	
Passthrough	annotations	transfer	any	taint	from	an	input	to	an	output	of	the	target	method.	It	can	also	
assign	or	remove	taint	from	the	output,	in	the	case	of	FortifyNumberPassthrough	and	
FortifyNotNumberPassthrough	.The	acceptable	values	for	the	in	annotation	parameter	are	""this""	
or	afunction	parameter	name.	The	acceptable	values	for	the	out	annotation	parameter	are	this	,	
return	,or	afunction	parameter	name.	
@FortifyPassthrough	(in=	""a""	,out=	""return""	)	
String	toLowerCase	(String	a)	{	
...
}

Appendix	D:	Fortify	Java	Annotations	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	176	of	216 

Use	FortifyNumberPassthrough	to	indicate	that	the	data	is	purely	numeric.	Numeric	data	cannot	
cause	certain	types	of	issues,	such	as	cross-	site	scripting,	regardless	of	the	source.	Using	
FortifyNumberPassthrough	can	reduce	false	positives	of	this	type.	If	aprogram	decomposes	
character	data	into	anumeric	type	(int,	int	[],	and	so	on),	you	can	use	FortifyNumberPassthrough	.If	
aprogram	concatenates	numeric	data	into	character	or	string	data,	then	use	
FortifyNotNumberPassthrough	.	
The	following	is	acomplete	list	of	passthrough	annotations:	
l	FortifyPassthrough	
l	FortifyNumberPassthrough	
l	FortifyNotNumberPassthrough	
Sink	Annotations	
Sink	annotations	report	an	issue	when	taint	of	the	appropriate	type	reaches	an	input	of	the	target	
method.	Acceptable	values	for	the	annotation	parameter	are	this	or	afunction	parameter	name.	
@FortifyXSSSink	(""a""	)	
void	printToWebpage	(int	a)	{	
...
}	
You	can	also	apply	the	annotation	to	the	function	argument	or	the	return	parameter.	In	the	following	
example,	an	issue	is	reported	when	taint	reaches	the	argument	a.	
void	printToWebpage	(int	b,	@FortifyXSSSink	String	a)	{	
...
}	
The	following	is	acomplete	list	of	the	sink	annotations:	
l	FortifySink

Validate	Annotations	
Validate	annotations	remove	taint	from	an	output	of	the	target	method.	Acceptable	values	for	the	
annotation	parameter	are	this	,return	,or	afunction	parameter	name.	
@FortifyXSSValidate	(""return""	)	
String	xssCleanse	(String	a)	{

l	FortifyCommandInjectionValidate	
l	FortifyPCIValidate	
l	FortifyPrivacyValidate	
l	FortifySQLValidate	
l	FortifySystemInfoValidate	
l	FortifyXSSValidate	
Field	and	Variable	Annotations	
You	can	apply	these	annotations	to	fields	and	(in	most	cases)	variables.	
Password	and	Private	Annotations	
Use	password	and	private	annotations	to	indicate	whether	the	target	field	or	variable	is	apassword	or	
private	data.	
@FortifyPassword	String	x;	
@FortifyNotPassword	String	pass;	
@FortifyPrivate	String	y;	
@FortifyNotPrivate	String	cc;	
In	the	previous	example,	string	xwill	be	identified	as	apassword	and	checked	for	privacy	violations	and	
hardcoded	passwords.	The	string	pass	will	not	be	identified	as	apassword.	Without	the	annotation,	it	
might	cause	false	positives.	The	FortifyPrivate	and	FortifyNotPrivate	annotations	work	
similarly,	only	they	do	not	cause	privacy	violation	issues.

Non-	Negative	and	Non-	Zero	Annotations	
Use	these	annotations	to	indicate	disallowed	values	for	the	target	field	or	variable.	
@FortifyNonNegative	int	index;	
@FortifyNonZero	double	divisor;	
In	the	previous	example,	an	issue	is	reported	if	anegative	value	is	assigned	to	index	or	zero	is	assigned	
to	divisor	.

Use	the	FortifyCheckReturnValue	annotation	to	add	atarget	method	to	the	list	of	functions	that	
require	acheck	of	the	return	values.	
@FortifyCheckReturnValue
int	openFile	(String	filename	){

}	
Dangerous	Annotations	
With	the	FortifyDangerous	annotation,	any	use	of	the	target	function,	field,	variable,	or	class	is	
reported.	Acceptable	values	for	the	annotation	parameter	are	CRITICAL	,HIGH	,MEDIUM	,or	LOW	.These	
values	indicat	how	to	categorize	the	issue	based	on	the	Fortify	Priority	Order	values).

Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	Properties	Files	
The	properties	files	are	located	in	the	<sca_	install_	dir>	/Core/config	directory.	
The	installed	properties	files	contain	default	values.	Fortify	recommends	that	you	consult	with	your	
project	leads	before	you	make	changes	to	the	properties	in	the	properties	files.	You	can	modify	any	of	
the	properties	in	the	configuration	file	with	any	text	editor.	You	can	also	specify	the	property	on	the	
command	line	with	the	-D	option.	
The	following	table	describes	the	primary	properties	files.	Additional	properties	files	are	described	in	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	Tools	Properties	Reference	Guide	.	
Properties	File	Name	Description	
fortify-	sca.properties	Defines	the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	configuration	properties.	
fortify-	sca-	
quickscan.properties	
Defines	the	configuration	properties	applicable	for	aFortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	quick	scan.	
Properties	File	Format	
In	the	properties	file,	each	property	consists	of	apair	of	strings:	the	first	string	is	the	property	name	and	
the	second	string	is	the	property	value.	
com.fortify.sca.fileextensions.htm=HTML
As	shown	above,	the	property	sets	the	translation	to	use	for	.htm	files.	The	property	name	is	
com.fortify.sca.fileextension.htm	and	the	value	is	set	to	HTML	.	
Micro	Focus	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	(20.2.0	)	Page	180	of	216 

Note:	When	you	specify	apath	for	Windows	systems	as	the	property	value,	you	must	escape	any	
backslash	character	(\)	with	abackslash	(for	example:	
com.fortify.sca.ASPVirtualRoots.Library=C:\\WebServer\\CustomerA\\inc	).	
Disabled	properties	are	commented	out	of	the	properties	file.	To	enable	these	properties,	remove	the	
comment	symbol	(#)	and	save	the	properties	file.	In	the	following	example,	the	
com.fortify.sca.LogFile	property	is	disabled	in	the	properties	file	and	is	not	part	of	the	
configuration:
#	default	location	for	the	log	file

You	can	also	specify	avalue	of	oracle:	<path_	to_	
script>	to	programmatically	supply	alanguage	type.	
Provide	ascript	that	accepts	one	command-	line	parameter	
of	afile	name	that	matches	the	specified	file	extension.	
The	script	must	write	the	valid	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	file	type	(see	previous	list)	¬†to	stdout	and	exit	
with	areturn	value	of	zero.	If	the	script	returns	anon-	zero	
return	code	or	the	script	does	not	exist,	the	file	is	not	
translated	and	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	writes	a

Separate	the	file	list	with	semicolons	(Windows)	or	colons	
(non-	Windows	systems).	
Note:	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	only	uses	this	
property	during	translation	without	build	integration.	
When	you	integrate	with	acompiler	or	build	tool,	
Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	translates	all	source	files	
that	the	compiler	or	build	tool	processes	even	if	they	
are	specified	with	this	property.

specify	Unicode	file	paths	in	the	options	file.	Valid	
encoding	names	are	from	the	
java.nio.charset.Charset
Note:	This	property	is	only	valid	in	the	fortify-

com.fortify.sca.
InputFileEncoding	
Specifies	the	source	file	encoding	type.	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	allows	you	to	scan	aproject	that	contains	
differently	encoded	source	files.	To	work	with	amulti-	
encoded	project,	you	must	specify	the	-encoding	option	
in	the	translation	phase,	when	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	first	reads	the	source	code	file.	Fortify	Static	
Code	Analyzer	remembers	this	encoding	in	the	build	
session	and	propagates	it	into	the	FVDL	file.	
Typically,	if	you	do	not	specify	the	encoding	type,	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	uses	file.encoding	from	the	
java.io.InputStreamReader	constructor	with	no	
encoding	parameter.	In	afew	cases	(for	example	with	the	
ActionScript	parser),	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	defaults	
to	UTF-	8.

xcode.TranslateAfterError	
Specifies	whether	the	xcodebuild	touchless	adapter	
continues	translation	if	the	xcodebuild	subprocess	exited	
with	anon-	zero	exit	code.	If	set	to	false,	translation	stops	
after	encountering	anon-	zero	xcodebuild	exit	code	and	
the	Fortify	Static	Code	Analyzer	touchless	build	halts	with	
the	same	exit	code.	If	set	to	true,	the	Fortify	Static	Code	
Analyzer	touchless	build	executes	translation	of	the	build	
file	identified	prior	to	the	xcodebuild	exit,	and	Fortify	
Static	Code	Analyzer	exits	with	an	exit	code	of	zero	
(unless	some	other	error	also	occurs).	
Regardless	of	this	setting,	if	xcodebuild	exits	with	anon-	
zero	code,	then	the	xcodebuild	exit	code,	stdout,	and	
stderr	are	written	to	the	log	file.

Technology shapes how businesses innovate and grow
Digital transformation happens in the cloud 
This disruption occurs because technology is changing faster than ever before. 
Breakthrough innovations in sensors, social media, apps and data are causing the volume 
of data to explode. Fortunately, the scale and economics of cloud computing make it 
possible to capture and harness data, creating new opportunities to innovate, grow faster, 
and achieve more than ever before. 
Digital transformation and the cloud are intertwined. Studies show that companies that 
embrace the cloud grow faster than those who do not. It‚Äôs no wonder that in the near 
future almost all workloads will be based in the cloud. 
Technology is a business disruptor
Digital transformation encourages the disruption of 
markets, steadily decreasing the average lifespan of 
companies on the S&P 500 over time. 
Companies that embrace digital transformation can 
manage increasing volatility regardless of their 
industry.

capacity can be changed 
quickly, better matching the 
performance requirements of 
new workloads, speeding up 
deployment while effectively 
managing costs.	
Intelligent migration
Improve the utilization of 
clusters suffering from highly 
variable jobs. CDP Public 
Cloud simplifies migrating 
these workloads, so they get 
the capacity they require

UniFFI Applied to DIDComm_rs 

UDL for didcomm_rsNote:  [Self=ByArc] is used since didcomm_rs required an Arc<T> for the self parameter (object ison the heap).UniFFI specifies how Rust objects (thatmaycontainmultiple public members & methods) are presented to calling applications.  Note: from a UniFFI perspective a referenced object can only be presented as either:1.Object (interface): ‚Ä¢Contains methods‚Ä¢Passed byreferenceor2.Dictionary:  ‚Ä¢Contains data elements‚Ä¢Passed by valueInUniFFI, anobjectcannotbepresentedasbothanobjectanda dictionary. 

didcomm_rs:message.rsAdded:  Using getters & setters allows access to data elements by objects without needing direct access.  This allows the didcommMessage object to be specified by UniFFI as an object interface while still allowing calling applications to access and modify the object member variables. 

Scaffolding layer is auto-generated as:didcomm-rs.UniFFI.UniFFI.rs 

Language wrapper is auto-generated as:didcomm-rs.swift 

Once the UniFFI generation is performed, the didcomm_rs test routines are easily called from Swift.Source:  https://github.com/anonyome/didcomm-rs 

Limitations (temporary?) 

libindy:  blob_storage.rsCore methodWith FutureAdded:  Method Without FutureReturn Result objectNote:  UniFFI does not (currently?) support the Rust Future designator, so a companion function, u_open_reader(), was created without the Future designator and this method was specified in the .udlfile.  

libindy:  anoncreds.rsReturn a dictionaryReturns a tupleNote:  UniFFI does not currently support the return of custom tuples.  To compensate, a custom dictionary type (containing the tuple members) was created and added to pub fnissuer_create_schema().  This allows the data to be returned and accessed by the calling application.

Non,"WasmFX: Structured Stack Switching for WebAssembly
Daniel Hillerstr√∂m
Computing Systems Laboratory Zurich Research Center

September 22, 2023 

WebAssembly: a low-level virtual machine (Haas et al. 2017)
What is Wasm? A portable bytecode format
An abstraction of the commonly found hardware
A predictable performance model
Code format A Wasm ‚Äúprogram‚Äù is a structured module
Designed for stream compilation
The term language is
statically typedand block-structuredControl flow is structured (
i.e.all CFGs are reducible)
Exciting future prospects Running non-JavaScript code in the browser
Secure-by-compilation cloud-native applications
Efficient cross-platform portable applications           

The need for stack switching in Wasm
Non-local control is pervasive in programming languages Async/await (e.g. C
++
, C #
, Dart, JavaScript, Rust, Swift) Coroutines (e.g. C
++
, Kotlin, Python, Swift) Lightweight threads (e.g. Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Swift)
Generators and iterators (e.g. C
#
, Dart, Haskell, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python) First-class continuations (e.g. Haskell, Java, OCaml, Scheme)
The problem
How do I compile non-local control flow abstractions to Wasm?Solution
Add each abstraction as a primitive to Wasm
Ceremoniously transform my entire source programs (e.g. Asyncify, CPS)

Characterising Asyncify
Pros
Expressive
Source-to-source transformation
Optimisable under a closed-world assumption Cons
Code size blowup
Slowdown pure code
Whole-program approach
But, what is Asyncify? The key primitives are
Unwind stack, delimit unwind, and rewind stackor expressed with a slightly different terminology:
Suspend continuation, delimit suspend, and resume continuation
Asyncify provides a particular implementation of
delimited continuations!(the state machine approach dates back at least as far as Adya et al. (2002))

Extending ROOT through Modules

Abstract.	The ROOT software framework is foundational for the HEP ecosys-
tem, providing multiple capabilities such as I/O, a C++ interpreter, GUI, and
math libraries. It uses object-oriented concepts and build-time components to
layer between them. We believe that a new layering formalism will beneÔ¨Åt the
ROOT user community.
We present the modularization strategy for ROOT which aims to build upon
the existing source components, making available the dependencies and other
metadata outside of the build system, and allow post-install additions on top of
existing installation as well as in the ROOT runtime environment. Components
can be grouped into packages and made available from repositories in order
to provide a post-install step of missing packages. This feature implements a
mechanism for the more comprehensive software ecosystem and makes it avail-
able even from a minimal ROOT installation. As part of this work, we have
reduced inter-component dependencies in order to improve maintainability.
The modularization eÔ¨Äort draws inspiration from similar eÔ¨Äorts in the Java,
Python, and Swift ecosystems. Keeping aligned with modern C++, this strategy
relies on forthcoming features such as C++ modules. We hope formalizing the
component layer provides simpler ROOT installs, improves extensibility, and
decreases the complexity of embedding ROOT in other ecosystems.	
1 Introduction
One of the advantages of object-oriented systems is the ability to have abstraction layers
that provide separation between the user interfaces and implementations. Ultimately, it is an
important tool to help to scale projects to larger code bases. Another technique for scaling
projects is to use a modularization. Modularisation provides a grouping of functionality into
distinct units with clear points of interaction. While ROOT [1] has a strong history in object-
oriented programming, it doesn‚Äôt have as a strong a concept of modular components. Thus,
we propose to add new concepts to the ROOT ecosystem:
1.Component : A set of interdependent classes implementing coherent functionality and
providing well-deÔ¨Åned APIs. A librarycould be deÔ¨Åned as a component or set of
related components that expose functionality and which can be invoked by a program
or another library.

2.Package : A distinct, self-describing resource (Ô¨Åle, URL) that provide one or more
components (such as a library and associated non-code resources).
3. Package database: A record of all packages currently available in a ROOT installation.
4. Package manager : An actor that can locate and install packages into a ROOT instal-
lation from a package reference (such as a package URL), along with their transitive
dependencies.
Similar to ROOT, other large object-oriented software systems consist of a number of
interdependent and loosely-coupled classes and are mostly organized as a set of libraries and
build targets. In these cases, classes are often used as the lowest level of granularity and can
serve as a unit of software modularization. In ecosystems such as Java, Python, and C++, a further package structure can allow soft-
ware developers to organize their programs into components. A good organization of classes
into identiÔ¨Åable and collaborating packages simpliÔ¨Åes the understanding and the maintenance
of the software. Yet another technique to improve the quality of the software modularization
is to provide technical mechanisms for encouraging coders to utilize these package structures.	
2 Motivation
Software modularization deÔ¨Ånes a way of grouping functionalities. It outlines groups in the
form of components, which identify a particular piece of functionality that solves a speciÔ¨Åc
problem. Often, it provides a way for coders to carefully specify the visibility of interfaces
and diÔ¨Äerentiate this between inside the package and outside. In general, modularization
helps reducing management, coordination and development costs. We aim to deÔ¨Åne a set of
mechanisms that enable a modular version of ROOT, centered around C++ modules [2] and
the concept of software packages. ROOT libraries have a very complex set of interdependencies. By introducing a com-
ponent layer on top of these libraries, we provide better boundaries between components,
allowing ROOT to scale as a project. We hope this can also make it easier for external com-
munities to develop packages on top of ROOT and easily distribute them ‚Äì without needing
to get their work into ROOT‚Äôs oÔ¨Écial codebase. A Ô¨Årst step is to deÔ¨Åne a minimal ROOTpackage, removing as many dependencies as pos-
sible, until only the simplest user functionality remains; we decided the minimal functionality
should eÔ¨Äectively be the I/O libraries and C++ interpreter. By having a smaller size and set
of external dependency, we increase the chances that its functionality can be embedded in
other contexts and enables ROOT users to interact with the broader data science ecosystem. Packages and package management provides a mechanism for ROOT users to socialize
and reuse projects built on top of ROOT. We aim to help make ROOT more Ô¨Çexible and open
it to the new customers. This feature would allow ROOT to serve as a community nexus.
In particular, it provides the ROOT team with an improved mechanism to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to new
components within the ROOT source itself as users can directly share their packages among
each other or in a conventional store such as GitHub.
3 ROOT components and packages
The ROOT code [3] is organized into a set of sub-directories per component, with the excep-
tion of the ROOT Core library, which has a more complex structure of subfolders. A component is a single unit of code distribution or set of classes for a framework or
an application that is built and ready to be shipped. Another C++ module [4] or another	
component can import it with a hook, such as an ‚Äúinclude"" keyword in case of headers (or the
‚Äúimport"" keyword in case of C++modules).
As an example, Figure 1 shows how a package can be created based on multiple com-
ponents. Here, a hypothetical ROOT-ML packageconsists of the TMVA (‚ÄúToolkit for Multi-
variate Data Analysis"") component and ROOT RDataframe as its dependencies. The ROOT modularization work is well-aligned with the eÔ¨Äort to integrate C++ modules
work going [2] in ROOT. C++ modules provide a simple way to produce software libraries
with improved compile-time scalability and management of the API of a library. C++ mod-
ules improve encapsulation and outline a clear relationship between public and private part
of the code, splitting the two into implementation and interface. For ROOT, we are working
on an ecosystem to improve versioning and binary distribution.

Figure 1: Example of ROOT component and package.
One of the main challenges is to deÔ¨Åne the package granularity; best practices here re-
main an open question. Too large number of components in packages defeats the purpose of
modularization. Similarly, packages should not contain too many small components as this
may introduce signiÔ¨Åcant package management overhead. A Ô¨Årst ROOT package to deÔ¨Åne is ROOT Base, which includes cling (the C++ inter-
preter), ROOT I/O, and other ‚ÄòCore‚Äô components. ROOT Baseis a fundamental part from
which we start to modularize ROOT framework. Another example of a ROOT package would
be a ROOTMath package that consists of multiple mathrelated components, such as ROOT
libraries MathCore, MathMore and VecCore (see Listing 1). We deÔ¨Åne a package to be a grouping of software and associated resources intended for
its distribution and reuse. In order to create a package, we assume a speciÔ¨Åc organization
of code for build and deploy steps. The package‚Äôs deÔ¨Ånition, versioning, metadata, content
description, and build information is contained in a manifest Ô¨Åle. An example of our manifest
Ô¨Åle format is shown in Listing 1. Package resources can include build byproducts such as a
shared library or an executable, or the package documentation and unit tests. The manifest
example was inspired by Swift manifests [5], and is written in YAML [6]. Entities who may interact with manifest Ô¨Åles may include:

1. ROOT subsystem developer (such as an I/O developer): Here, the purpose of the mani-
fest is strictly informational. The information for manifest is generated from the build
system; the build system will help to produce the manifest Ô¨Åle.
2. The third-party developer : For example, a Ph.D. student who wrote a new ROOT pack-
age as a part of work on the thesis and would like to describe in a human-readable from
a build description of his package and which ROOT components it depends on.
3. A member of an experiment physics group: Provides the ability to build a particular
library on demand or to share their developments.
4 Package manager design prototype
As a part of the package manager prototype was deÔ¨Åned two diÔ¨Äerent future work areas:
ROOT Base package as a fundamental part of ROOT, and development of ROOT package
management tool.
4.1 Evolving ‚ÄúMinimal ROOT‚Äù to ‚ÄúROOT Base‚Äù
While generating the ROOT libraries dependency graph, we can quickly notice that it is hard
to visualize a small core of ROOT as desired for our ROOT Base package.
ROOT‚Äôs build system provides a ‚Äúminimal ROOT‚Äù option that is supposed to build only
the essential functionality of ROOT required for basic I/O operations. At the outset of this
project, nearly Ô¨Åfty components were built when this minimaloption was enabled; we believe
that ‚ÄúMinimal ROOT‚Äù has migrated away from its original goal of being only a core-like

1. ROOT subsystem developer (such as an I/O developer): Here, the purpose of the mani-
fest is strictly informational. The information for manifest is generated from the build
system; the build system will help to produce the manifest Ô¨Åle.
2. The third-party developer : For example, a Ph.D. student who wrote a new ROOT pack-
age as a part of work on the thesis and would like to describe in a human-readable from
a build description of his package and which ROOT components it depends on.
3. A member of an experiment physics group: Provides the ability to build a particular
library on demand or to share their developments.
4 Package manager design prototype
As a part of the package manager prototype was deÔ¨Åned two diÔ¨Äerent future work areas:
ROOT Base package as a fundamental part of ROOT, and development of ROOT package
management tool.
4.1 Evolving ‚ÄúMinimal ROOT‚Äù to ‚ÄúROOT Base‚Äù
While generating the ROOT libraries dependency graph, we can quickly notice that it is hard
to visualize a small core of ROOT as desired for our ROOT Base package.
ROOT‚Äôs build system provides a ‚Äúminimal ROOT‚Äù option that is supposed to build only
the essential functionality of ROOT required for basic I/O operations. At the outset of this
project, nearly Ô¨Åfty components were built when this minimaloption was enabled; we believe
that ‚ÄúMinimal ROOT‚Äù has migrated away from its original goal of being only a core-like

For our purposes, the minimal requirement for the ROOT package manager is to be able
to deÔ¨Åne and resolve dependencies and versions through the manifest of the package. These
should be done either for ROOT packages or its external dependencies.
Ideas for future extensions are inspired by the functionality of Swift Package Manager
[8], which is supported by a large community:
1.Automated testing;
2. Support of cross-platform packages;
3. Support for operating system package managers (homebrew, etc.);
4. Support for version control system;
5. Standardized licensing;
6. Introduction of a package index;
7. Importing dependencies by source URL;
8. Component inter-dependency determination;
9. Complex dependency resolution.
Using beneÔ¨Åts from the introduction of C++ module infrastructure for ROOT, we fol-
lowed the ideas of Swift Package Manager and implemented a standalone tool - ‚Äòroot-get‚Äô
which provides functionality meeting the a minimal requirements described above.	
4.2.3 root-get prototype
We have implemented a dependency management tool for ROOT (Figure 2) called ‚Äòroot-get‚Äô.
It consists of the multiple modules that provide the desired package management functional-
ity:
1.Analyzer deÔ¨Ånes environment variables, checks if there are existing manifest/package
YAML Ô¨Åles, and sets up the environment (discovering the location of components and
packages and preparing for the manifest‚Äôs generation).
2. Generator encapsulates the ROOT CMake functions for generating information for
manifest Ô¨Åles. It allows one to conÔ¨Ågure ROOT modules and packages outside of
ROOT using special CMake Ô¨Åles containing the deÔ¨Ånitions about ROOT CMake func-
tions and ROOT external dependencies.
3. Downloader is a set of helper routines for downloading packages from Github or other
location.
4. Resolver is a module that provides a package database generation and resolution of
dependencies via generated direct acyclic graph (DAG).
5. Builder is a module that provides ROOT packaging scripts.
6. Integrator is a module that provides installation and deployment routine for ROOT
packages.	
A root-get is using the generic approach, existing for all ""package managers"" and works
directly with the source code of components. Manifest Ô¨Åles, in this case, are usually the Ô¨Åles
generated by static code analysis tools or provided by the user. The core part of package
manager workÔ¨Çow is a ""lock Ô¨Åle"". It is a Ô¨Åle containing the project dependencies that are
generated directly from manifest Ô¨Åles. The expected result after package manager operations
is a delivery of the set of artifacts: compiled source code and its dependencies, which can
serve as a direct ‚Äúinput‚Äù to the interpreter and usually generated from lock Ô¨Åle.
All compiled source code, declared by the lock Ô¨Åle should be arranged on disk in such
way that the compiler or interpreter can use it as intended, but it will be still isolated to avoid
mutation. ROOT components arranged as a set of packages could be installed in any location,
even outside of the install path of ROOT. All necessary components for the successful setup
are ROOT Base installation and root-get installed in the system.
ROOT Base together with root-get is capable of providing proper infrastructure for cus-
tom ROOT distribution and natural extension of ROOT functionalities, which includes the
possibility to build any ROOT components and also plug-in custom user components.

5 Conclusions
We have deÔ¨Åned the desired functionality for a package management ecosystem for ROOT.
We deÔ¨Åned a minimal and extended set of requirements for the ROOT package manager.
These ideas have been adopted into a preliminary prototype that can download and install
packages. As it matures, the prototype will be connected directly to the ROOT runtime and
serve as a runtime dependency management tool.

Sobre el Radar
Thoughtworkers son personas a las que les apasiona la tecnolog√≠a. La construimos, 
la investigamos, la probamos, abogamos 
por el c√≥digo abierto, escribimos sobre 
ella y constantemente tratamos de  mejorarla - para todas las personas. 
Nuestra misi√≥n es defender la 
excelencia del software y revolucionar  la TI. Creamos y compartimos el Radar 
Tecnol√≥gico de Thoughtworks en apoyo  de esa misi√≥n. El Technology Advisory Board de Thoughtworks, un grupo de  l√≠deres tecnol√≥gicos de alto nivel de 
Thoughtworks, crea el Radar. Se re√∫nen  peri√≥dicamente para debatir la estrategia 
tecnol√≥gica global de Thoughtworks y las 
tendencias tecnol√≥gicas que tienen un  impacto significativo en nuestra industria.
El Radar recoge el resultado de los 
debates del Technology Advisory Board 
en un formato que proporciona valor a  una amplia gama de partes interesadas, 
desde las personas desarrolladoras  hasta CTOs. El contenido pretende ser un 
resumen conciso.
 
Te animamos a explorar estas tecnolog√≠as.  El Radar es de naturaleza gr√°fica y agrupa los elementos en t√©cnicas, herramientas, 
plataformas y lenguajes y frameworks. 
Cuando los elementos del Radar pod√≠an  aparecer en varios cuadrantes, elegimos el que nos pareci√≥ m√°s apropiado. 
Adem√°s, agrupamos estos elementos  en cuatro anillos para reflejar nuestra posici√≥n actual al respecto.

Un vistazo al Radar
El Radar se dedica a rastrear cosas interesantes, a las que nos referimos como blips. Organizamos los blips en el Radar utilizando dos elementos de categorizaci√≥n: cuadrantes y anillos. Los cuadrantes 
representan los diferentes tipos de blips. Los anillos indican en qu√© fase del ciclo de vida de la adopci√≥n 
creemos que deber√≠an estar.
Un blip es una tecnolog√≠a o t√©cnica que desempe√±a un papel en el desarrollo de software. Los blips 
son cosas que est√°n ‚Äúen movimiento‚Äù, es decir, que su posici√≥n en el Radar est√° cambiando, lo que 
suele indicar que cada vez tenemos m√°s confianza en ellos a medida que avanzan por los anillos.
Nuestro Radar est√° orientado al futuro. Para dar paso a nuevos art√≠culos, desvanecemos los que no se han  movido recientemente, lo cual no es un reflejo de su valor, sino de nuestro limitado espacio en el Radar.

El Bazar Extra√±o:  El cambio econ√≥mico en Open-Source Software
En Thoughtworks, somos fieles seguidores del software de fuente abierta hace tiempo, popularizado 
en parte por el famoso ensayo de Eric Raymond ‚ÄúThe Cathedral and the Bazaar‚Äù. El software de  fuente abierta abre una ventana al desarrollo de software y promueve la colaboraci√≥n abierta hacia la 
correcci√≥n de errores y la innovaci√≥n. Sin embargo, los intentos de comercializaci√≥n del software de  fuente abierta han demostrado la enorme complejidad econ√≥mica del actual ecosistema. Esto se ha 
visto, por ejemplo, en el forking de AWS ‚Äúy‚Äù Elasticsearch hacia OpenSearch en Septiembre de 2021  como respuesta al cambio en la licencia por parte de Elastic al requerir a los proveedores de cloud-
service, que se beneficiaban de su trabajo, a contribuir de vuelta. Esto muestra cu√°n dif√≠cil puede 
ser para un comercial de software de fuente abierta el mantener un ‚Äúfoso econ√≥mico‚Äù. (La misma  preocupaci√≥n se aplica con los software de fuente cerrada gratuitos, pues hemos sido testigos de 
que algunas compa√±√≠as exploran alternativas a Docker Desktop debido al esfuerzo continuo de  Docker en encontrar un modelo comercial √≥ptimo). A veces, la din√°mica de poder puede funcionar al 
contrario: debido a que Facebook fundara Presto como un producto open-source, los ‚Äúmaintainers‚Äù 
(‚Äúlos que se quedaron‚Äù) fueron capaces de mantener la IP y cambiarle el nombre de la marca por 
Trino despu√©s de que estos se hubieran marchado de la compa√±√≠a, benefici√°ndose as√≠ de la inversi√≥n  de Facebook.
La historia se vuelve incluso m√°s engorrosa cuando hablamos de la la cantidad de infraestructura 
cr√≠tica que no es patrocinada por corporaciones, donde las compa√±√≠as se dan cuenta de cu√°nto de 
verdad necesitan apoyarse en ‚Äútrabajo no pagado‚Äù cuando aparecen bugs cr√≠ticos de seguridad 
(como ha pasado recientemente con Lo4J). En algunos casos, financiar a ‚Äúhobbyist maintainers‚Äù a trav√©s de GitHub o Patreon proporciona el 
suficiente impulso para hacer la diferencia; en otros casos, simplemente se crea un sentimiento de  responsabilidad, adicional a su trabajo diario y contribuye al agotamiento. Seguimos siendo √°vidos 
seguidores del software de fuente abierta pero somos conscientes que la econom√≠a alrededor se  est√° convirtiendo cada vez m√°s en algo m√°s bizarro, y no hay soluciones f√°ciles para encontrar el 
equilibrio adecuado.
Innovaciones de la Cadena de Suministro de Software
Instancias p√∫blicas de problemas severos ‚Äî La filtraci√≥n de datos de Equifax, el ataque a SolarWinds,  la vulnerabilidad de d√≠a cero de Log4J entre otros  ‚Äî que fueron causadas por una escasa 
gobernanza de la cadena de suministro de software. Los equipos ahora entienden que las pr√°cticas 
de ingenier√≠a responsables incluyen validar y gestionar las dependencias de los proyectos, esto es  un motivador de varios blips de esta edici√≥n del Radar. Las entradas incluyen listas de verificaci√≥n 
y est√°ndares tales como Niveles de la Cadena de Suministro para Artefactos de Software (SLSA,  por sus siglas en ingl√©s) , un consorcio respaldado por Google para proveer gu√≠as de las amenazas

est√°ndar a la cadena de suministro, y CycloneDX, , otro grupo de est√°ndares manejados por la 
comunidad OWASP. Tambi√©n presentamos herramientas concretas como Syft , la cual genera una 
Lista de Materiales del Software (SBOM) desde im√°genes de contenedores. Los hackers est√°n 
cada vez tomando m√°s ventaja de la naturaleza asim√©trica de la ofensa y defensa en el campo de la 
seguridad ‚Äî solo necesitan encontrar vulnerabilidades, mientras que los defensores deben asegurar  toda la superficie de ataque ‚Äî mientras usan t√©cnicas de hackeo cada vez m√°s sofisticadas. Una 
seguridad mejorada de la cadena de suministro es una pieza cr√≠tica de nuestra respuesta al trabajar  para mantener seguros los sistemas.
Por qu√© los programadores siguen implementando State 
Management en React?
Distintos tipos de frameworks emergentes tienden a aparecer de manera regular en el Radar: un 
framework se hace popular, seguido por numerosas herramientas que crean un ecosistema de 
deficiencias y mejoras comunes, dando lugar a la consolidaci√≥n de varias herramientas populares. 
Sin embargo, React state management parece ser resistente a esta tendencia. Desde que Redux se  lanz√≥, hemos visto una corriente de herramientas y frameworks que manejan el estado de maneras 
ligeramente diferentes; cada una de ellas con una serie de desventajas. No sabemos porqu√©, s√≥lo 
podemos especular: ¬øEs √©sta la din√°mica de reemplazo que JavaScript pareciera que promueve? 
¬øAcaso hay una deficiencia debajo de React, un problema divertido y aparentemente manejable que  anima a los desarrolladores a experimentar? O es la permanente discordancia entre el formato de lectura de documentos (navegadores web) y la interactividad (y el estado) necesarios para acoger el 
desarrollo de aplicaciones sobre documentos?  No sabemos la raz√≥n, pero esperamos a la siguiente  ronda de intentos de solucionar este problema a simple vista permanente.
La interminable b√∫squeda de El Master Data Catalog
El deseo de sacar m√°s valor de los activos de datos corporativos est√° detr√°s de la mayor√≠a de las inversiones que estamos viendo en el √°mbito de la tecnolog√≠a digital. Principalmente, este esfuerzo 
se centra en crear maneras m√°s efectivas de encontrar y tener acceso a datos que sean relevantes.  Desde el comienzo en el que las compa√±√≠as empezaron a recabar datos digitales, han existido 
esfuerzos de racionalizar y crear un sistema de acceso √∫nico, y de arriba hacia abajo, a un directorio 
de datos corporativo. Sin embargo, una y otra vez, esta idea en principio atractiva se da de bruces 
con la realidad compleja, redundante y ambigua propias de grandes organizaciones. Recientemente  hemos identificado un renovado inter√©s en cat√°logos de datos corporativos y un surgimiento intermitente de propuestas en el Radar para nuevas e ingeniosas herramientas como Collibra  y 
DataHub . Estas herramientas pueden proveer acceso regular y detectabilidad al linaje y metadatos 
a trav√©s de silos, pero su cada vez m√°s grande conjunto de caracter√≠sticas tambi√©n se extiende a la  gobernanza, gesti√≥n de calidad, publicaci√≥n y m√°s.
En contraste con esta moda, tambi√©n parece haber un creciente movimiento que se aleja del manejo 
de datos desde arriba hacia abajo y centralizado, hacia una gobernanza federada y el descubrimiento  basado en una arquitectura de malla de datos. Este m√©todo ataja la complejidad inherente de los 
datos corporativos fijando expectativas y est√°ndares de una manera central, pero segregando la 
custodia del dato a trav√©s de las l√≠neas de dominio. Los equipos de productos de datos orientados 
al dominio controlan y comparten sus propios metadatos incluyendo detectabilidad, calidad y otra  informaci√≥n. En este escenario, el cat√°logo es s√≥lo una forma de mostrar informaci√≥n para b√∫squeda 
y navegaci√≥n. Los cat√°logos de datos resultantes son m√°s simples, m√°s f√°ciles de mantener y  reducen la necesidad de plataformas enriquecidas de catalogaci√≥n y plataformas de gobernanza.

1. Cuatro m√©tricas clave
AdoptarPara medir el rendimiento de la entrega de software, cada vez m√°s organizaciones recurren por 
defecto a las cuatro m√©tricas clave definidas por el programa DORA research : tiempo de espera de 
los cambios, frecuencia de despliegue, tiempo medio de restauraci√≥n (MTTR) y porcentaje de fallos 
en los cambios. Esta investigaci√≥n y su an√°lisis estad√≠stico han demostrado una clara relaci√≥n entre 
el alto rendimiento de la entrega y estas m√©tricas; proporcionan un gran indicador de c√≥mo lo est√°  haciendo una organizaci√≥n de entrega en su conjunto.
Seguimos siendo grandes defensores de estas m√©tricas, pero tambi√©n hemos aprendido algunas  lecciones. Seguimos observando enfoques err√≥neos con herramientas que ayudan a los equipos 
a medir estas m√©tricas bas√°ndose √∫nicamente en sus conductos de entrega continua (CD). En  particular, cuando se trata de las m√©tricas de estabilidad (MTTR y porcentaje de cambios fallidos), los datos del pipeline de CD por s√≠ solos no proporcionan suficiente informaci√≥n para determinar 
qu√© es un fallo de despliegue con impacto real en el usuario. Las m√©tricas de estabilidad s√≥lo tienen 
sentido si incluyen datos sobre incidentes reales que degraden el servicio para los usuarios.
Recomendamos tener siempre presente la intenci√≥n √∫ltima de una medici√≥n y utilizarla para reflexionar y aprender. Por ejemplo, antes de dedicar semanas a la creaci√≥n de sofisticadas 
herramientas de cuadros de mando, considera la posibilidad de limitarse a realizar regularmente la 
comprobaci√≥n r√°pida del DORA en las retrospectivas del equipo. Esto da al equipo la oportunidad 
de reflexionar sobre qu√© capacidades  podr√≠an trabajar para mejorar sus m√©tricas, lo que puede ser 
mucho m√°s eficaz que la creaci√≥n de herramientas demasiado detalladas. Hay que tener en cuenta 
que estas cuatro m√©tricas clave se originaron a partir de la investigaci√≥n a nivel de organizaci√≥n de  los equipos de alto rendimiento, y el uso de estas m√©tricas a nivel de equipo debe ser una forma 
de reflexionar sobre sus propios comportamientos, no s√≥lo otro conjunto de m√©tricas para a√±adir al 
cuadro de mando.
2. Single team remote wall
Adoptar Un single team remote wall es una t√©cnica sencilla para reintroducir virtualmente el muro del 
equipo. Recomendamos que los equipos distribuidos adopten este enfoque; una de las cosas que 
escuchamos de los equipos que empezaron a trabajar en remoto es que echan de menos tener el  muro f√≠sico del equipo. Este era un espacio √∫nico donde se pod√≠an mostrar todas las tarjetas de 
historias de usuario, tareas, su estado y progreso, actuando como punto de informaci√≥n y centro 
de referencia para el equipo. El muro actu√≥ como un punto de integraci√≥n con los datos reales 
almacenados en diferentes sistemas. A medida que los equipos se volvieron remotos, tuvieron que 
acudir de nuevo a los distintos sistemas para buscar la informaci√≥n, por lo que obtener una ‚Äúvisi√≥n  general‚Äù de un proyecto se ha vuelto muy complicado. Si bien puede haber algo de esfuerzo extra  para mantenerlo actualizado, creemos que los beneficios para el equipo valen la pena. Para algunos 
equipos, actualizar el muro f√≠sico formaba parte de las ‚Äúceremonias‚Äù diarias que el equipo hac√≠a en 
conjunto, y lo mismo se puede hacer con un muro remoto.
3. Malla de datos (Data mesh)
Probar
La malla de datos Data mesh  es un enfoque organizativo y t√©cnico descentralizado a la hora de 
compartir, acceder y gestionar los datos para la anal√≠tica y el ML. Su objetivo es crear un enfoque 
T√©cnicas

sociot√©cnico que ampl√≠e la obtenci√≥n de valor de los datos a medida que crezca la complejidad de la organizaci√≥n y proliferen los casos de uso de los datos y se diversifiquen las fuentes de los mismos.  Esencialmente, crea un modelo de intercambio de datos responsable que est√° en consonancia con 
el crecimiento de la organizaci√≥n y el cambio continuo. Seg√∫n nuestra experiencia, el inter√©s por  la aplicaci√≥n de la malla de datos ha crecido enormemente. Este enfoque ha inspirado a muchas 
organizaciones a adoptarlo y a los proveedores de tecnolog√≠a a readaptar sus tecnolog√≠as existentes  para una implantaci√≥n de malla. A pesar del gran inter√©s y la creciente experiencia en la malla de 
datos, sus implantaciones se enfrentan a un elevado coste de integraci√≥n. Adem√°s, su adopci√≥n 
sigue limitada a secciones de grandes organizaciones y los proveedores de tecnolog√≠a est√°n  distrayendo a las organizaciones de los aspectos socio m√°s duros de la malla de datos: la propiedad 
descentralizada de los datos y un modelo operativo de gobierno federado.
Estas ideas se exploran en Data Mesh, Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale , que gu√≠a a los 
profesionales, arquitectos, l√≠deres t√©cnicos y responsables de la toma de decisiones en su transici√≥n 
desde una arquitectura tradicional de big data a la malla de datos. Proporciona una introducci√≥n 
completa a los principios de la malla de datos y sus componentes; cubre c√≥mo dise√±ar una 
arquitectura de malla de datos, guiar y ejecutar una estrategia de malla de datos y navegar por el  dise√±o organizativo hacia un modelo de propiedad de datos descentralizado. El objetivo del libro 
es crear un nuevo marco para profundizar en las conversaciones y conducir a la siguiente fase de  madurez de la malla de datos.
4. Definici√≥n de listo para producci√≥n
Probar
En una organizaci√≥n que practica el principio ‚Äúlo construyes, lo ejecutas‚Äù, una definici√≥n de listo para  producci√≥n (DPR, por sus siglas en ingl√©s), es una t√©cnica √∫til para ayudar a los equipos a evaluar y 
preparar la disponibilidad operacional de nuevos servicios. Implementada como una lista de puntos o 
una plantilla, un DPR da a los equipos una gu√≠a sobre qu√© tener en cuenta y en qu√© pensar antes de  llevar un nuevo servicio a producci√≥n. Aunque los DRP no definen objetivos de servicio espec√≠ficos 
(SLOs, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) a cumplir (esto pueden ser dif√≠ciles de definir de forma general),  recuerdan a los equipos en qu√© categor√≠a de SLOs pensar, qu√© est√°ndares organizacionales cumplir, 
y qu√© documentaci√≥n es necesaria. Los DRP, nos dan una fuente de informaci√≥n que los equipos  convierten en los requerimientos de producto espec√≠ficos, por ejemplo: observabilidad y fiabilidad,  para incluir en sus backlog de producto.
Los DPR est√°n √≠ntimamente relacionados con el concepto propuesto por Google en production  readiness review (PRR) . En organizaciones demasiado peque√±as como para tener un equipo de 
ingenier√≠a de fiabilidad (SRE, por sus siglas en ingl√©s), o preocupadas porque un proceso de panel de 
revisi√≥n pueda impactar el flujo de salida a producci√≥n de un equipo, tener un DPR puede al menos 
ofrecer una gu√≠a documentada de criterios acordados a nivel de organizaci√≥n. Para nuevos servicios 
de alta criticidad, se puede a√±adir un mayor nivel de escrutinio en cunplimiento de DPR mediante un  PRR.

5. Cuadrantes de documentaci√≥n
Probar
Escribir buena documentaci√≥n es un aspecto que se pasa por alto en el desarrollo de software y 
que suele dejarse para el √∫ltimo momento y se realiza de manera desordenada. Algunos de nuestros 
equipos han encontrado en los cuadrantes de documentaci√≥n  una manera pr√°ctica de garantizar 
que se produzcan los artefactos correctos. Esta t√©cnica clasifica los artefactos sobre dos ejes: El  primer eje est√° relacionado con la naturaleza de la informaci√≥n, pr√°ctica o te√≥rica; el segundo eje 
describe el contexto en el que el artefacto es usado, estudiado o trabajado. Esta t√©cnica define 
cuatro cuadrantes en los cuales artefactos como tutoriales, gu√≠as pr√°cticas o p√°ginas de referencia  pueden ser clasificadas y entendidas. Este sistema de clasificaci√≥n no solo asegura que artefactos 
cr√≠ticos no sean pasados por alto sino que tambi√©n gu√≠a la presentaci√≥n del contenido. Hemos 
encontrado esto particularmente √∫til a la hora de crear documentaci√≥n de onboarding que facilita la  r√°pida puesta al d√≠a de nuevos desarrolladores cuando se unen a un nuevo equipo.
6. Repensando las reuniones diarias remotas
Probar
El t√©rmino standup tiene su origen en la idea de ponerse de pie durante esta reuni√≥n de 
sincronizaci√≥n diaria, con el objetivo de hacerla breve. Se trata de un principio com√∫n que muchos  equipos intentan cumplir en sus reuniones diarias: que sean breves y directas. Pero ahora estamos 
viendo que los equipos desaf√≠an ese principio y est√°n ‚Äúrepensando las reuniones diarias remotas‚Äù.  Cuando se est√° en un mismo lugar, hay muchas oportunidades durante el resto del d√≠a para  sincronizarnos entre nosotros de forma espont√°nea, como complemento a la breve reuni√≥n diaria.  De forma remota, algunos de nuestros equipos est√°n experimentando un formato de reuniones m√°s  largas, similar a lo que la gente de Honeycomb llama ‚Äú sincronizaci√≥n de equipo serpenteante.‚Äù
No se trata de deshacerse por completo de una sincronizaci√≥n diaria; todav√≠a lo encontramos  muy importante y valioso, especialmente en un formato remoto. En cambio, se trata de extender 
el tiempo bloqueado en los calendarios de todos para la sincronizaci√≥n diaria hasta en una hora, y  usarlo de una manera que haga obsoletas algunas de las otras reuniones y acerque al equipo. En  las actividades a√∫n se puede incluir el bien probado recorrido por el tablero del equipo, para luego 
ampliarlo con discusiones de aclaraci√≥n m√°s detalladas, decisiones r√°pidas y tomarse el tiempo para 
socializar. La t√©cnica se considera exitosa si se reduce la carga general de la reuni√≥n y mejora la  uni√≥n del equipo.
7. Interfaz de usuario basada en servidor
Probar
Al armar un nuevo volumen del Radar, a menudo nos invade una sensaci√≥n de d√©j√† vu, y la t√©cnica  de server-driven UI genera un caso particularmente s√≥lido con la llegada de los frameworks que permiten a los desarrolladores de aplicaciones m√≥viles tomar ventaja de los ciclos de cambio m√°s 
r√°pidos mientras que no se falle en las pol√≠ticas de las tiendas de apps en torno a la revalidaci√≥n de  la propia aplicaci√≥n m√≥vil. Lo hemos comentado antes desde la perspectiva de permitir el desarrollo 
m√≥vil para escalar a trav√©s de los equipos . La interfaz de usuario basada en servidor separa la 
representaci√≥n en un contenedor gen√©rico en la aplicaci√≥n m√≥vil mientras que la estructura y la 
data para cada vista es provista por el servidor. Esto significa que los cambios que alguna vez  requirieron un viaje de ida y vuelta a una tienda de apps pueden ahora ser logrados a trav√©s de 
cambios simples en las respuestas que env√≠a el servidor. Nota, no estamos recomendando este 
acercamiento para todos los desarrollos de interfaz de usuario, de hecho hemos experimentado 
algunos problemas terribles y demasiado configurados, pero con el respaldo de gigantes como

8. Software Bill of Materials
Probar
Con la continua presi√≥n de mantener los sistemas seguros y sin reducci√≥n en el panorama general  de amenazas, un machine-readable Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) puede ayudar a los equipos 
a estar al tanto de los problemas de seguridad de las librer√≠as en las que conf√≠an. El m√°s reciente, el  d√≠a cero del exploit remoto Log4Shell  ue critico y ampliamente conocido. Si los equipos hubieran 
tenido un SBOM listo, este hubiera escaneado y corregido r√°pidamente el mismo. Ahora hemos 
tenido experiencia en ambientes de producci√≥n usando SBOMs en proyectos que se encuentran 
tanto en compa√±√≠as peque√±as como en grandes multinacionales, hasta en departamentos de 
gobierno, y estamos convencidos que proveen beneficios. Herramientas como Syft  hacen f√°cil el 
uso de SBOM para detectar vulnerabilidades.
9. Bifurcaci√≥n T√°ctica
Probar
Bifucarci√≥n t√°ctica  es una t√©cnica que puede ayudar con la reestructuraci√≥n o migraci√≥n de 
monolitos a microservicios. Espec√≠ficamente, esta t√©cnica ofrece una posible alternativa al enfoque 
m√°s com√∫n de primero modularizar completamente el c√≥digo, que en muchas circunstancias puede 
tomar mucho tiempo o ser muy dif√≠cil de alcanzar. Con la bifurcaci√≥n t√°ctica un equipo puede crear  una nueva bifurcaci√≥n del c√≥digo y usarla para tratar y extraer un √°rea o problema en particular  mientras se elimina el c√≥digo innecesario. El uso de √©sta t√©cnica probablemente s√≥lo ser√≠a parte de 
un plan a largo plazo para el monolito en general.
10. Carga cognitiva del equipo
Probar
La arquitectura de los sistemas imita la estructura de la organizaci√≥n y su comunicaci√≥n. No es  novedad que las interacciones de equipo deben ser deliberadas. Ver, por ejemplo, la maniobra inversa de Conway (Inverse Conway Maneuver) . La interacci√≥n del equipo es una de las variables 
de la rapidez y facilidad con la que los equipos pueden entregar valor a sus clientes. Estuvimos  felices de encontrar una manera de medir estas interacciones, usamos la evaluaci√≥n  del autor de 
Topolog√≠as de Equipo , que te ayuda a comprender qu√© tan f√°cil o dif√≠cil les resulta a los equipos 
desarrollar, testear y mantener sus servicios. Midiendo la carga cognitiva del equipo, pudimos 
aconsejar mejor a nuestros clientes sobre c√≥mo cambiar la estructura de sus equipos y fomentar sus  interacciones.
11. Arquitectura de transici√≥n
Probar
Una arquitectura de transici√≥n  es una pr√°ctica √∫til utilizada para el reemplazo de los sistemas 
heredados. Al igual que los andamios pueden construirse, reconfigurarse y finalmente retirarse 
durante la construcci√≥n o renovaci√≥n de un edificio, pasos arquitect√≥nicos provisionales durante 
el desplazamiento de lo heredado. Las arquitecturas de transici√≥n se eliminar√°n o sustituir√°n  m√°s adelante, pero no son un trabajo desechable, dado el importante rol que desempe√±an en la 
reducci√≥n del riesgo y en permitir que un problema dif√≠cil se divida en pasos m√°s peque√±os. Por

tanto, ayudan a evitar la trampa de caer en un enfoque de reemplazo heredado ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù, porque no 
se puede hacer que los pasos intermedios m√°s peque√±os se alineen con una visi√≥n arquitect√≥nica  final. Hay que tener cuidado para asegurarse de que el ‚Äúandamiaje‚Äù arquitect√≥nico se elimine 
finalmente, para que no se convierta en una deuda t√©cnica m√°s adelante.
12. CUPID
Evaluar
¬øC√≥mo te planteas la escritura de un buen c√≥digo? ¬øC√≥mo puedes juzgar si has escrito c√≥digo de  calidad? Como desarrolladores de aplicaciones, siempre estamos buscando reglas, principios y patrones que podamos utilizar para compartir un lenguaje y unos valores a la hora de escribir c√≥digo 
simple y f√°cil de modificar.
Daniel Terhorst-North ha hecho recientemente un nuevo intento para crear una lista de control para un 
buen c√≥digo. Sostiene que, en lugar de ce√±irse a un conjunto de reglas como  SOLID, es m√°s aplicable 
el uso de un conjunto de propiedades a las que aspirar. Ha ideado lo que llama las propiedades 
CUPID  para describir lo que debemos hacer para conseguir un c√≥digo ‚Äúalegre‚Äù: el c√≥digo debe ser 
componible, seguir la filosof√≠a Unix y ser predecible, idiom√°tico y basado en el dominio.
13. Dise√±o inclusivo
Evaluar
Recomendamos a las organizaciones a evaluar dise√±o inclusivo  como manera de asegurar que 
la accesibilidad es considerada un requisito de primer nivel. Muy habitualmente los requisitos de 
accesibilidad e inclusividad son ignorados hasta justo antes, o incluso despu√©s, del lanzamiento  de software. La forma m√°s barata y simple de incluir estos requisitos, a la vez que damos feedback  pronto a los equipos, es integr√°ndolos completamente en el proceso de desarrollo. En el pasado, 
hemos mencionado t√©cnicas que priorizan los requisitos de seguridad y multifuncionales; una 
perspectiva de esta t√©cnica es que consigue lo mismo para accesibilidad.
14. Patr√≥n de operador para recursos no agrupados
Evaluar
Continuamos viendo un incremento en el uso del patr√≥n de Operador de Kubernetes  con prop√≥sitos 
m√°s all√° de administrar aplicaciones desplegadas en el cl√∫ster. Usando el patr√≥n de operador para 
recursos no agrupados se aprovechan las definiciones de recurso personalizado y el mecanismo 
de programaci√≥n guiado por eventos implementados en el panel de control de Kubernetes para 
gestionar las actividades que est√°n relacionadas fuera del cluster. Esta t√©cnica se basa en la idea 
de Kube-managed cloud services  y la extiende a otras actividades, como despliegue continuo o 
reacci√≥n a cambios en repositorios externos. Una de las ventajas de √©sta t√©cnica por encima de 
una herramienta especialmente dise√±ada, es que abre una amplia gama de herramientas que ya 
vienen incluidas en Kubernetes o son parte de un ecosistema m√°s amplio. Puedes usar comandos  como diff, dry-run o apply para interactuar con los recursos personalizados del operador. El  mecanismo de programaci√≥n de Kube hace que el desarrollo sea m√°s f√°cil al eliminar la necesidad 
de orquestar actividades en el orden correcto. Herramientas de c√≥digo abierto como Crossplane , 
Flux  y Argo CD  aprovechan √©sta t√©cnica, y esperamos ver m√°s de estas surgir con el tiempo. 
Aunque √©stas herramientas tienen sus casos de uso, tambi√©n estamos comenzando a ver un mal  uso y abuso de √©sta t√©cnica y necesitamos repetir un viejo consejo: S√≥lo porque puedas hacer 
algo con una herramienta no significa que debas. Aseg√∫rate de descartar enfoques m√°s sencillos y  convencionales antes de crear una definici√≥n de recurso personalizada y asumir la complejidad que 
este enfoque implica.

15. Malla de servicios sin sidecar
Evaluar
Malla de servicios  suele implementarse como un proxy inverso, tambi√©n conocido como sidecar, 
desplegado a la par de cada instancia de servicio. Aunque estos procesos de sidecar suelen ser  ligeros, el coste general y la complejidad a la hora de adoptar una malla de servicios se incrementa 
con cada nueva instancia de servicio que requiere un sidecar adicional. Sin embargo, con los 
avances en eBPF , estamos observando un nuevo enfoque de malla de servicios sin sidecar  donde 
las funcionalidades de la malla son transferidas de forma segura al n√∫cleo del SO, habilitando a 
los servicios que se ejecutan en el mismo nodo a comunicarse de forma transparente a trav√©s de 
sockets, sin necesidad de proxies adicionales. Puedes probar esto con Cilium service mesh  y 
simplificar el despliegue pasando de un proxy por servicio a un proxy por nodo. Estamos intrigados  por las capacidades de eBPF y por eso nos parece importante evaluar est√° evoluci√≥n de la malla de 
servicios
16. SLSA
Evaluar
A medida que el software contin√∫a aumentando en complejidad, el vector de ataque a trav√©s de  dependencias de software se convierte en algo cada vez m√°s dif√≠cil contra lo que protegerse. La reciente vulnerabilidad de Log4J nos mostr√≥ c√≥mo de dif√≠cil puede ser incluso conocer esas 
dependencias ‚Äî muchas compa√±√≠as que no usaban Log4J directamente fueron vulnerables sin 
saberlo solo por el hecho de que otro software en su ecosistema depend√≠a de esta librer√≠a. Supply  chain Levels for Software Artifacts, o SLSA  (pronunciado ‚Äúsalsa‚Äù), es un conjunto de gu√≠as curadas 
por un consorcio para que las organizaciones se protejan de ataques contra la cadena de suministro, 
ha sido evolucionado a partir de las gu√≠as internas que Google ha estado usando por a√±os. 
Apreciamos que SLSA no promete una ‚Äúbala de plata‚Äù con un enfoque centrado en herramientas para  proteger la cadena de suministro, sino que proporciona una lista de amenazas concretas y pr√°cticas junto con un modelo de madurez. El modelo de amenazas  es f√°cil de entender ya que cuenta con 
ejemplos reales de ataques, y los requisitos  proveen una gu√≠a para ayudar a las organizaciones 
a priorizar acciones basadas en niveles incrementales de robustez para mejorar su postura de 
seguridad en la cadena de suministro. Creemos que SLSA provee consejos aplicables y esperamos  que m√°s organizaciones aprendan de ello.
17. Almac√©n de datos de streaming
Evaluar
La necesidad de responder r√°pidamente a los conocimientos de los clientes ha impulsado la 
creciente adopci√≥n de arquitecturas basadas en eventos y el procesamiento de flujos. Marcos como 
Spark , Flink  o Kafka Streams  ofrecen un paradigma en el que consumidores y productores de 
eventos simples pueden cooperar en redes complejas para ofrecer informaci√≥n en tiempo real. Pero 
este estilo de programaci√≥n requiere tiempo y esfuerzo para dominarlo y, cuando se implementa 
como aplicaciones de un solo punto, carece de interoperabilidad. Hacer que el procesamiento 
de flujos funcione universalmente a gran escala puede requerir una importante inversi√≥n en  ingenier√≠a. Ahora, est√° surgiendo una nueva cosecha de herramientas que ofrece las ventajas del 
procesamiento de flujos a un grupo m√°s amplio y establecido de desarrolladores que se sienten 
c√≥modos utilizando SQL para implementar los an√°lisis. La estandarizaci√≥n de SQL como lenguaje 
de flujo universal reduce la barrera para la implementaci√≥n de aplicaciones de flujo de datos.  Herramientas como ksqlDB  y Materialize ayudan a transformar estas aplicaciones separadas en 
plataformas unificadas. En conjunto, una colecci√≥n de aplicaciones de streaming basadas en SQL en 
toda una empresa podr√≠a constituir un almac√©n de datos de streaming.

18. TinyML
Evaluar
Hasta hace poco, la ejecuci√≥n de un modelo de machine-learning (ML) se consideraba costosa 
desde el punto de vista computacional y, en algunos casos, requer√≠a un hardware de prop√≥sito 
especial. Si bien la creaci√≥n de los modelos todav√≠a entra dentro de esta clasificaci√≥n, es posible 
crearlos de forma que puedan ejecutarse en dispositivos peque√±os, de bajo coste y bajo consumo 
de energ√≠a. Esta t√©cnica, denominada TinyML , ha abierto la posibilidad de ejecutar modelos de ML 
en situaciones que muchos podr√≠an considerar inviables. Por ejemplo, en dispositivos que funcionan 
con bater√≠as o en entornos desconectados con una conectividad limitada o irregular, el modelo  puede ejecutarse localmente sin un coste prohibitivo. Si te has planteado utilizar el ML pero has 
cre√≠do que no era realista debido a las limitaciones inform√°ticas o de red, merece la pena evaluar 
esta t√©cnica.
19. Azure Data Factory para orquestaci√≥n
Resistir
Para las organizaciones que utilizan Azure como su principal proveedor de servicios cloud, Azure 
Data Factor y  es actualmente la herramienta predeterminada en cuanto a la orquestaci√≥n de 
pipelines de procesamiento de datos. Es compatible con la ingesta de datos, copiando datos 
desde y hacia diferentes tipos de almacenamientos locales o en Azure y ejecutando l√≥gica de  transformaci√≥n. Aunque s√≠ que hemos tenido una experiencia adecuada con Azure Data Factory en  migraciones sencillas de almacenamientos de datos desde local a la nube, no recomendamos el uso 
de Azure Data Factory para orquestaci√≥n de pipelines complejas de procesamiento de datos y flujos 
de trabajo. Hemos tenido alg√∫n √©xito con Azure Data Factory cuando lo hemos usado principalmente  para mover datos entre sistemas. Para los pipelines de datos m√°s complejos, todav√≠a tiene sus retos, incluyendo una depuraci√≥n mediocre y el informe de errores. Adicionalmente, la observabilidad 
es limitada, ya que la capacidad de registro de Azure Data Factory no se integra con otros  productos como Azure Data Lake Storage o Databricks, lo que hace que sea complicado conseguir 
observabilidad extremo a extremo. Adicionalmente, la disponibilidad de los mecanismos de data 
source-triggering (desencadenamiento de fuente de datos) est√° limitada a ciertas regiones. En estos  momentos, animamos a usar otras herramientas de c√≥digo libre para la orquestaci√≥n (e.g., Airflow 
para las pipelines de datos complejas y limitar el uso de Azure Data Factory para la copia de datos o  la toma de instant√°neas. Nuestros equipos siguen utilizando Data Factory para mover y extraer datos, 
pero para operaciones m√°s amplias recomendamos otras herramientas con un flujo de trabajo m√°s 
completo.
20. Equipos de plataformas miscel√°neas
Resistir
Anteriormente, hab√≠amos presentado los equipos de productos de ingenier√≠a de plataformas  en 
Adoptar, como una buena manera de operar para los equipos de plataformas internos, que permite  a los equipos de entrega implementar y operar sistemas en menos tiempo y con herramientas m√°s sencillas. Desafortunadamente, estamos viendo la etiqueta de ‚Äúequipo de plataformas‚Äù 
aplicada a equipos dedicados a proyectos que no tienen resultados claros o un conjunto de  clientes bien definido. Como consecuencia, estos equipos de plataformas miscel√°neas , como los  llamamos, tienen dificultades para entregar debido a las altas cargas cognitivas y a la falta de una 
alineaci√≥n clara de prioridades, ya que est√°n lidiando con una colecci√≥n miscel√°nea de sistemas  que no tienen relaci√≥n entre s√≠. De hecho, se convierten en otro equipo de apoyo general para las 
cosas que no encajan, o que no quieren en otros lados. Seguimos creyendo que los equipos de  productos de ingenier√≠a de plataformas centrados en un producto (interno) claro y bien definido 
ofrecen una mejor serie de resultados.

21. Datos de producci√≥n en entornos de prueba
Resistir
Seguimos viendo a los datos de producci√≥n en entornos de prueba como un √°rea de preocupaci√≥n.  En primer lugar, muchos casos de esto han resultado en un da√±o considerable, por ejemplo, 
cuando se ha enviado una alerta incorrecta desde un sistema de prueba a toda una poblaci√≥n 
de clientes. En segundo lugar, el nivel de seguridad, espec√≠ficamente en torno a la protecci√≥n de 
datos privados, tiende a ser menor para los sistemas de prueba. No tiene mucho sentido tener 
controles elaborados sobre el acceso a los datos de producci√≥n si esos datos son copiados a una  base de datos de prueba a la que pueden acceder las personas desarrolladoras y QAs. Aunque 
es posible ofuscar la informaci√≥n, esto tiende a aplicarse s√≥lo a campos espec√≠ficos, tal como  n√∫meros de tarjetas de cr√©dito. Por √∫ltimo, copiar datos de producci√≥n a sistemas de prueba 
puede infringir las leyes de privacidad, por ejemplo, cuando los sistemas de prueba se alojan o son 
accedidos desde un pa√≠s o regi√≥n diferente. Este √∫ltimo escenario es especialmente problem√°tico  con despliegues complejos en la nube. Los datos falsos son un enfoque m√°s seguro, y existen  herramientas para ayudar en su creaci√≥n. Reconocemos que hay razones para copiar elementos 
espec√≠ficos de los datos de producci√≥n, por ejemplo, en la reproducci√≥n de una incidencia o para 
el entrenamiento de modelos ML espec√≠ficos. Aqu√≠ nuestro consejo es proceder con precauci√≥n.
22. SPA por defecto
Resistir
Generalmente evitamos poner blips en Espera cuando consideramos que la recomendaci√≥n es  demasiado obvia, lo que incluye seguir a ciegas un estilo m√°s architectural sin poner atenci√≥n 
a los trade-offs. Sin embargo, debido a la dominancia pura por parte de los equipos al elegir 
aplicaciones de una p√°gina (Single-Page Applications o SPA) cuando realmente lo que necesitan  es una p√°gina web, nos preocupa hasta tal punto que nos sugiere que no est√°n ni tan siquiera  reconociendo SPAs como un estilo de arquitectura y, en vez de ello, se lanzan directamente 
a la elecci√≥n de la infraestructura. SPAs generan una complejidad extra que no existe con  las tradicionales p√°ginas web (server-web based): herramientas de optimizaci√≥n, gesti√≥n y 
administraci√≥n del historial de b√∫squeda, an√°lisis web, tiempo de carga de la p√°gina principal,  etc. Esta complejidad est√° generalmente justificada por temas relacionados con la experiencia 
de usuario, y tanto es as√≠, que se contin√∫an desarrollando herramientas para poder abordar con  mayor facilidad estas preocupaciones (aunque la agitaci√≥n en la comunidad de React en torno 
a la gesti√≥n de estado nos da una pista de lo dif√≠cil que puede ser el obtener una soluci√≥n de 
aplicabilidad general).
Sin embargo, muy a menudo nos encontramos con equipos que no realizan an√°lisis de trade- off, sino que aceptan a ciegas esa complejidad extra de ‚ÄúSPA por defecto‚Äù incluso cuando  las necesidades de negocio no la justifican. De hecho, hemos empezado a notar que muchos 
desarrolladores ‚Äúnovatos‚Äù ni siquiera son conscientes de un m√©todo alternativo a SPA, pues han  pasado la mayor√≠a de su carrera trabajando con infraestructuras similares a React. Creemos que 
muchas p√°ginas web se beneficirar√°n de la simplicidad de la l√≥gica de servidor server-side, y 
nos apoyamos en t√©cnicas como Hotwire  que ayudan a acortar ese brecha en la experiencia de 
usuario.

23. Azure DevOps 
Probar
Debido a que el ecosistema Azure DevOps  sigue creciendo, nuestros equipos lo utilizan con √©xito 
cada vez m√°s. Estos servicios contienen un conjunto de servicios administrados, que incluyen  repositorios Git alojados, pipelines de compilaci√≥n y despliegue, herramientas de pruebas 
automatizadas, utilidades de administraci√≥n de tareas pendientes y repositorio de artefactos.  Hemos visto a nuestros equipos adquirir experiencia en esta plataforma con muy buenos resultados,  lo que significa que Azure DevOps est√° madurando. Particularmente nos gusta su flexibilidad; 
permiti√©ndonos usar los servicios que uno desea incluso si estos son de diferentes proveedores. Por 
ejemplo, es posible usar un repositorio Git externo al mismo tiempo que los servicios de pipelines de 
Azure DevOps. Nuestros equipos est√°n especialmente entusiasmados con Azure DevOps Pipelines . 
A medida que el ecosistema madura, vemos un aumento en la incorporaci√≥n de equipos que ya se  encuentran utilizando Azure, ya que se integra f√°cilmente con el resto del mundo de Microsoft.
24. Las plantillas de Azure Pipelines
Probar
Las plantillas de Azure Pipelines  te permiten eliminar la duplicidad cuando defines tus Azure 
Pipelines, a trav√©s de dos mecanismos. Con ‚Äúincluir‚Äù plantillas, puedes hacer referencia a una  plantilla, de tal forma que se expandir√° en l√≠nea como una macro parametrizado de C++, permitiendo 
as√≠ una forma sencilla de reutilizar una configuraci√≥n com√∫n en todas las etapas, trabajos y pasos. 
Con ‚Äúextender‚Äù plantilla, puedes definir una capa exterior con la configuraci√≥n com√∫n de la pipeline 
y con la aprobaci√≥n requerida de la plantilla , puedes hacer que la compilaci√≥n falle si la pipeline no 
extiende de ciertas plantillas, previniendo ataques maliciosos contra la propia configuraci√≥n de la  pipeline. Junto con [CircleCI]((/es/radar/platforms/circleci), Orbs y el todav√≠a m√°s reciente GitHub 
Actions Reusable Workflows , las plantillas de Azure Pipeline son parte de la tendencia sobre la 
creaci√≥n de modularidad en el dise√±o de las pipelines a lo largo de m√∫ltiples plataformas y varios de  nuestros equipos han estado contentos utiliz√°ndolo.
25. CircleCI
Probar
Muchos de nuestros equipos eligen CircleCI  para sus necesidades de integraci√≥n continua y 
aprecian su capacidad para ejecutar pipelines complejas de manera eficiente. Los desarrolladores  de CircleCI contin√∫an agregando nuevas funcionalidades con CircleCI, ahora en la versi√≥n 3.0. 
Orbs  y executors  fueron llamados por nuestros equipos como particularmente √∫tiles. Los Orbs son 
fragmentos de c√≥digo reutilizables que automatizan procesos repetidos, aceleran la configuraci√≥n 
de proyectos y facilitan la integraci√≥n con herramientas de terceros. La amplia variedad de tipos 
de ejecutores brinda flexibilidad para configurar trabajos en m√°quinas virtuales en Docker, Linux,  macOS o Windows..
26. Couchbase
Probar
Cuando cubrimos Couchbase  originalmente en 2013, se consideraba principalmente un cach√© 
persistente que evolucion√≥ de una fusi√≥n entre Membase  y CouchDB. Desde ese entonces, ha 
mejorado constantemente y un ecosistema de herramientas relacionadas y oferta comercial se ha 
desarrollado en torno a √©l. Entre las novedades de la suite del producto est√° Couchbase Mobile y 
el Couchbase Sync Gateway. Estas funcionalidades trabajan juntas para mantener actualizados los 
datos persistentes en dispositivos perif√©ricos, incluso cuando el dispositivo est√° fuera de red por 
Plataformas	
21
Thoughtworks Technology Radar© Thoughtworks, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  

periodos extendidos de tiempo debido a conectividad intermitente. A medida que estos dispositivos 
proliferan, vemos una necesidad m√°s grande de persistencia embebida que contin√∫a funcionando 
est√© el dispositivo conectado o no. Recientemente, uno de nuestros equipos valor√≥ Couchbase  por su capacidad de sincronizaci√≥n offline, y descubri√≥ que esta capacidad existente les ahorr√≥ 
considerable esfuerzo que de otra manera lo habr√≠an tenido que invertir en tiempo propio.
27. eBPF
Probar
Desde hace varios a√±os, el kernel de Linux incluye el filtro de paquetes Berkeley extendido 
( eBPF ), una m√°quina virtual que ofrece la posibilidad de adjuntar filtros a determinados sockets. 
Pero eBPF va mucho m√°s all√° del filtrado de paquetes y permite activar scripts personalizados 
en varios puntos del kernel con muy poca sobrecarga. Aunque esta tecnolog√≠a no es nueva, est√° 
cobrando importancia con el creciente uso de microservicios desplegados como contenedores 
orquestados. Los Kubernetes y la tecnolog√≠a de malla de servicios (Services Mesh) como Istio  se 
utilizan habitualmente, y emplean sidecars para implementar la funcionalidad de control. Con las  nuevas herramientas, ‚Äî Bumblebee  en particular, hace que la construcci√≥n, ejecuci√≥n y distribuci√≥n 
de programas eBPF sea mucho m√°s f√°cil - eBPF puede ser visto como una alternativa al sidecar  tradicional. Un mantenedor de Cilium , una herramienta en este espacio, ha llegado a proclamar 
la desaparici√≥n del sidecar . Un enfoque basado en eBPF reduce parte de la sobrecarga de 
rendimiento y operaci√≥n que conllevan los sidecars, pero no da soporte a funciones comunes como  la terminaci√≥n SSL.
28. GitHub Actions
Probar
GitHub Actions  ha crecido considerablemente el a√±o pasado. Ha demostrado que puede asumir 
flujos de trabajo m√°s complejos y llamar a otras acciones en acciones compuestas, entre otras cosas. 
Sin embargo, todav√≠a tiene algunas deficiencias, como su incapacidad para volver a activar un solo  trabajo de un flujo de trabajo. Aunque el ecosistema en el GitHub Marketplace  tiene sus ventajas 
obvias, al dar acceso a las Acciones de GitHub de terceros a tu pipeline de construcci√≥n se corre 
el riesgo de compartir secretos de forma insegura (recomendamos seguir los consejos de GitHub 
sobre security hardening ). Sin embargo, la comodidad de crear tu flujo de trabajo de compilaci√≥n 
directamente en GitHub junto a tu c√≥digo fuente, combinada con la capacidad de ejecutar las 
Acciones de GitHub localmente utilizando herramientas de c√≥digo abierto como act  es una opci√≥n 
convincente que ha facilitado la configuraci√≥n y la incorporaci√≥n de nuestros equipos.
29. GitLab CI/CD
Probar
Si est√°s usando GitLab  para administrar la entrega de software, tambi√©n deber√≠as darle un vistazo 
a GitLab CI/CD para tus necesidades de integraci√≥n y entrega continua. Hemos comprobado que  es especialmente √∫til cuando se utiliza con GitLab con ejecutores en servidores OnPremise y auto- hospedados, ya que esta combinaci√≥n evita los dolores de cabeza de autorizaci√≥n que suelen 
producirse al utilizar una soluci√≥n basada en la nube. Los ejecutores auto-hospedados pueden 
configurarse completamente para tus prop√≥sitos con el sistema operativo y las dependencias 
correctas instaladas y, como resultado, los pipelines pueden ejecutarse mucho m√°s r√°pido que 
cuando se utiliza un ejecutor hospedado en la nube que necesita configurarse cada vez.
Adem√°s de las operaciones b√°sicas de compilaci√≥n, pruebas y despliegue de pipelines, este  producto de GitLab soporta el uso de Services, Auto Devops y ChatOps, entre otras caracter√≠sticas 
avanzadas. Los Services son √∫tiles al ejecutar servicios Docker como Postgres o Testcontainer  
Plataformas	
22

vinculados a un job para integraci√≥n y pruebas de extremo a extremo. Auto Devops crea pipelines que no requieren configuraciones, lo que es muy √∫til para los equipos que son nuevos en la entrega 
cont√≠nua o para las organizaciones con muchos repositorios que de otro modo tendr√≠an que crear  muchos pipelines manualmente.
30. Google BigQuery ML
Probar
Desde la √∫ltima vez que hablamos sobre Google BigQuery ML , se han agregado modelos m√°s 
sofisticados, como Redes Neuronales Profundas y de Tablas con Autoaprendizaje, al conectar  BigQuery ML con TensorFlow y Vertex AI como backend. BigQuery tambi√©n ha introducido 
soporte para previsi√≥n de series temporales. Una de nuestra preocupaciones anteriormente era  explicabilidad . A principios de este a√±o fue anunciado BigQuery Explainable AI , dando un paso 
para abordar esto. Tambi√©n podemos exportar modelos de BigQuery ML a Cloud Storage como 
Tensorflow SavedModel y usarlos para predicci√≥n online. A√∫n quedan cosas pendientes como  la dificultad de ‚Äúentrega continua para aprendizaje autom√°tico‚Äù pero con su facilidad de uso, 
BigQuery ML sigue siendo una opci√≥n atractiva, sobre todo si la informaci√≥n ya est√° en BigQuery.
31. Google Cloud Dataf low
Probar
Google Cloud Dataflow  es un servicio de procesamiento de datos basado en la nube para 
aplicaciones de transmisi√≥n de datos en tiempo real y por lotes. Nuestros equipos usan Dataflow  para crear flujos de procesamiento para integrar, preparar y analizar grandes conjuntos de datos, 
con el modelo de programaci√≥n unificado de Apache Beam  para facilitar su administraci√≥n. 
Presentamos Dataflow por primera vez en 2018, y su estabilidad, rendimiento y conjunto completo 
de funciones nos dan confianza para moverlo a la secci√≥n Trial en esta edici√≥n del Radar.
32. Flujos de trabajo reutilizables en Github Actions 
Probar
Hemos visto un creciente inter√©s en GitHub Actions  desde que se hizo blip por primera vez hace 
dos Radars. Con el lanzamiento de los flujos de trabajo reutilizables , GitHub ha continuado 
evolucionando el producto de forma que aborda algunas de sus limitaciones iniciales. Los flujos de  trabajo reutilizables en GitHub Actions aportan modularidad al dise√±o de pipeline, permitiendo la  reutilizaci√≥n parametrizada incluso a trav√©s de repositorios (siempre y cuando el repositorio de flujo 
de trabajo sea p√∫blico). Soportan el paso expl√≠cito de valores confidenciales en forma de secretos, 
y el resultado es devuelto al proceso que lo ha llamado. Con unas cuantas lineas de YAML, Github 
Actions ahora aporta el tipo de flexibilidad que se ve en CircleCI  Orbs o Azure Pipeline Templates, 
pero sin tener que dejar la plataforma GitHub.
33. Sealed Secrets
Probar
Kubernetes  soporta de manera nativa un objeto valor-clave (key-value en ingl√©s) como secretos 
(secrets en ingl√©s). Sin embargo, por defecto los secret en Kubernetes no son realmente secretos.  Estos son manipulados separadamente de otros datos key-value con precauciones o con controles 
de acceso que pueda ser aplicados de manera separada. Existe soporte para encriptar secrets 
antes de que sean guardados en etcd , pero estos empiezan como campos de texto plano en 
archivos de configuraci√≥n. 
Plataformas	
23
Thoughtworks Technology Radar© Thoughtworks, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  

Secretos sellados (Sealed Secrets en ingl√©s) es una combinaci√≥n entre el operador y la utilidad 
de la l√≠nea de comando que usa claves asim√©tricas para encriptar secrets de manera que solo  pueden ser descifrados por un controlador del cl√∫ster. Este proceso asegura que los secrets 
no ser√°n comprometidos mientras se encuentren en los archivos de configuraci√≥n que definen 
el deployment en Kubernetes. Una vez encriptados, estos archivos pueden ser compartidos o 
almacenados de manera segura junto a otros artefactos del deployment.
34. VerneMQ
Probar
VerneMQ  es un broker MQTT de c√≥digo abierto, de alto rendimiento y distribu√≠do. En el pasado 
hemos analizado otros brokers MQTT como Mosquitto  y EMQ. Al igual que EMQ y RabbitMQ, 
VerneMQ est√° tambi√©n basado en Erlang/OTP, lo que lo convierte en altamente escalable. Escala  tanto horizontalmente como verticalmente sobre hardware est√°ndar para soportar un gran n√∫mero 
de productores y consumidores, manteniendo una baja latencia y tolerancia a fallos. En nuestros  bancos de pruebas internos, hemos sido capaces de alcanzar algunos millones de conexiones 
concurrentes en un √∫nico cl√∫ster. Aunque no es nuevo, llevamos utiliz√°ndolo ya en producci√≥n 
durante alg√∫n tiempo y nos ha funcionado bien.
35. actions-runner-controller
Evaluar
actions-runner-controller  es un controlador que opera runners auto hospedados  para GitHub 
Actions  en tu cl√∫ster de Kubernetes. Con esta herramienta creas un recurso runner en Kubernetes, 
que ejecutar√° y operar√° el runner auto hospedado. Los runners auto hospedados son de mucha 
ayuda en escenarios d√≥nde el trabajo o job que tu GitHub Actions ejecuta necesita acceder a  recursos a los que los runners en la nube de GitHub no pueden acceder o tienen requerimientos 
espec√≠ficos para un sistema operativo y entorno que difieren de los que provee GitHub. En esos 
casos d√≥nde tienes un cl√∫ster de Kubernetes, puedes ejecutar tus runners auto hospedados como  un pod de Kubernetes, con la capacidad de escalar conect√°ndose con los eventos de los webhooks 
de GitHub.
36. Apache Iceberg
Evaluar
Apache Iceberg  Es un formato de tabla abierta para conjuntos de datos anal√≠ticos muy grandes. 
Iceberg admite operaciones de datos anal√≠ticos modernos, como la inserci√≥n, actualizaci√≥n 
y eliminaci√≥n a nivel de registro, time-travel queries ,  transacciones ACID, partici√≥n oculta y 
evoluci√≥n completa del esquema . Soporta m√∫ltiples formatos de almacenamiento de archivos 
subyacentes como Apache Parquet , Apache ORC y Apache Avro . Muchos motores de 
procesamiento de datos soportan Apache Iceberg, incluyendo motores SQL como Dremio  y Tr i n o as√≠ 
como motores de streaming (estructurado) como Apache Spark  y Apache Flink.
Apache Iceberg est√° en la misma categor√≠a que Delta Lake  y Apache Hudi. Todos ellos soportan 
m√°s o menos caracter√≠sticas similares, pero cada uno difiere en las implementaciones subyacentes 
y en las listas de caracter√≠sticas detalladas. Iceberg es un formato independiente y no es nativo de  ning√∫n motor de procesamiento espec√≠fico, por lo que es soportado por un n√∫mero creciente de 
plataformas, incluyendo AWS Athena  y Snowflake. Por la misma raz√≥n, Apache Iceberg, a diferencia 
de los formatos nativos como Delta Lake, puede no beneficiarse de las optimizaciones cuando se  utiliza con Spark.

37. Blueboat
Evaluar
Blueboat  es una plataforma multiplataforma para aplicaciones web sin servidor. Aprovecha el 
popular motor JavaScript V8 e implementa bibliotecas de aplicaciones web de uso com√∫n de 
forma nativa en Rust  para seguridad y rendimiento. Se puede pensar en Blueboat como una 
alternativa a CloudFlare Workers  o Deno Deploy pero con una distinci√≥n importante ‚Äî debe 
operar y administrar la infraestructura subyacente. Dicho esto, le recomendamos que eval√∫e 
cuidadosamente Blueboat para sus necesidades locales sin servidor.
38. Cloudf lare Pages
Evaluar
Cuando los Cloudflare Workers  fueron liberados, los destacamos como una temprana funci√≥n como 
servicio (FaaS) para c√≥mputo de borde con una implementaci√≥n interesante. La liberaci√≥n de las 
Cloudflare Pages  del pasado Abril no se sinti√≥ como digna de menci√≥n, debido a que Pages es solo 
una en una clase de muchas soluciones respaldadas por Git y de alojamiento de sitios. Ten√≠a vistas  previas continuas, una funci√≥n √∫til que no se encuentra en la mayor√≠a de las alternativas. Ahora, sin 
embargo, Cloudfare tiene unos Workers y Pages integrados , m√°s enfocados, creando una soluci√≥n 
totalmente integrada Jamstack  corriendo sobre el CDN. La inclusi√≥n de un almacenamiento de 
clave-valor y una coordinaci√≥n primitiva fuerte y consistente mejoran a√∫n m√°s el atractivo de la  nueva versi√≥n de Cloudflare Pages.
39. Colima
Evaluar
Colima  se est√° convirtiendo en una popular alternativa abierta para Docker de Escritorio. Provee el 
tiempo de ejecuci√≥n del contenedor Docker en una m√°quina virtual (VM) Lima, configura la interfaz 
de l√≠nea de comando (CLI) en macOS y se encarga del port-forwarding y montaje de vol√∫menes. 
Colima utiliza containerd  como tiempo de ejecuci√≥n, que es el m√°s com√∫n en la mayor√≠a de 
servicios Kubernetes (lo cual mejora la relaci√≥n dev-prod). Con Colima se puede utilizar y probar  f√°cilmente las √∫ltimas caracter√≠sticas de containerd, tal como lazy loading para im√°genes en 
contenedores. Por su buen desempe√±o, vemos a Colima como una alternativa de software abierto 
con un gran potencial frente a Docker para Escritorio.
40. Collibra 
Evaluar
En el ambiente cada vez m√°s concurrido del mercado corporativo de cat√°logos de data, nuestros 
equipos han disfrutado al trabajar con Collibra . Les ha gustado la flexibilidad en el despliegue sea 
de un SaaS o de una instancia self-hosted, la gran amplitud de funcionalidad incluida out of the box,  tales como gobernanza de datos, linaje, calidad y observabilidad. Los usuarios tambi√©n tienen la 
opci√≥n de utilizar un peque√±o subconjunto de capacidades requeridas desde una aproximaci√≥n m√°s 
descentralizada como por ejemplo un data mesh . El verdadero punto extra se lo lleva su servicio al 
cliente muchas veces pasado por alto, quienes se han mostrado colaborativos y de gran soporte. Por 
supuesto, existe tensi√≥n entre cat√°logos de data simples y plataformas corporativas con mayores  funcionalidades, pero hasta ahora los equipos se encuentran muy contentos en c√≥mo Collibra ha 
soportado sus necesidades.

41. CycloneDX
Evaluar
CycloneDX  es un est√°ndar para describir una  Lista de materiales de software (SBOM) legible por 
una m√°quina. A medida que las estructuras del software y la computaci√≥n crecen en complejidad, 
el software se vuelve m√°s dif√≠cil de definir. Originario de OWASP, CycloneDX mejora el antiguo 
est√°ndar SPDX con una definici√≥n m√°s amplia que se extiende m√°s all√° de las dependencias 
de la m√°quina local para incluir dependencias de servicio en tiempo de ejecuci√≥n. Tambi√©n 
encontrar√°s implementaciones en varios lenguajes, un ecosistema  de soporte de integraciones y 
una herramienta de l√≠nea de comando CLI que te permite analizar y cambiar SBOMs con la firma y 
verificaci√≥n correspondientes.
42. Embeddinghub
Evaluar
Embeddinghub  es una base de datos vectorial para embeddings , de machine learning, bastante 
similar a Milvus . Sin embargo, dado que tiene soporte disponible para operaciones de vecino 
m√°s cercano (NN) aproximado, particionamiento, control de versiones y control de accesos, 
recomendamos evaluar Embeddinghub para sus casos de embedding vectorial.
43. Temporal 
Evaluar
Temporal  es una plataforma para desarrollar flujos de trabajo de larga duraci√≥n, particularmente 
para arquitecturas de microservicios. Es una variante del anterior proyecto de OSS Cadence  de 
Uber, tiene un modelo de aprovisionamiento de eventos para flujos de trabajo de larga duraci√≥n para 
que puedan sobrepasar ca√≠das de procesos o infraestructura. A pesar de que no recomendamos 
el uso de transacciones distribuidas en arquitectura de microservicios, si realmente necesitas  implementarlas o larga duraci√≥n Sagas , puedes considerar darle un vistazo a Temporal.

44. tfsec
AdoptarPara nuestros proyectos en los que usamos Terraform , tfsec se ha convertido r√°pidamente en una 
herramienta de an√°lisis est√°tico predeterminada para detectar potenciales riesgos de seguridad. Es 
f√°cil de integrar en un CI pipeline y tiene una librer√≠a en crecimiento de verificaciones contra todos  los principales proveedores y plataformas de la nube como Kubernetes. Dado que es sencillo de usar, 
creemos que tfsec podr√≠a ser una buena adici√≥n para cualquier proyecto de Terraform.
45. AKHQ
Probar
AKHQ  es una interfaz de usuario para Apache Kafka que permite administrar topics, informaci√≥n 
sobre los topics, grupos de consumidores y mucho m√°s. Algunos de nuestros equipos han  encontrado a AKHQ como una herramienta efectiva para mirar en tiempo real el estado de su 
aplicaci√≥n Kafka. Puedes, por ejemplo, buscar los distintos topics dentro de tu grupo. Por cada  topic, puedes visualizar el nombre, el n√∫mero de mensajes almacenados, el espacio de disco usado, 
el tiempo del √∫ltimo registro, el n√∫mero de particiones, el factor de replicaci√≥n con la cantidad de  in-sync y el grupo de consumidores. Con opciones de deserializaci√≥n para Avro y Protobuf, AKHQ 
puede ayudarte a entender el flujo de informaci√≥n en tu aplicaci√≥n Kafka.
46. cert-manager 
Probar
cert-manager  es una herramienta para administrar los certificados X.509 dentro de tu cluster 
de  Kubernetes.  Modela certificados y emisores como tipos de recursos de primera clase y 
provee certificados como servicio de manera segura a los desarrolladores y aplicaciones que 
se ejecutan dentro del cluster de Kubernetes. La opci√≥n obvia cuando se utiliza el controlador  ingress predeterminado de Kubernetes, tambi√©n se recomienda para otros y es preferible por 
sobre el despliegue de tu propia gesti√≥n manual de certificados. Varios de nuestros equipos han  estado utilizando cert-manager ampliamente y tambi√©n hemos comprobado que su usabilidad ha  mejorado mucho en los √∫ltimos meses.
47. Cloud Carbon Footprint
Probar
Cloud Carbon Footprint  (CCF) es una herramienta de c√≥digo abierto que utiliza APIs en la nube para 
proporcionar visualizaciones de emisiones de carbono estimadas en funci√≥n del uso de AWS, GCP 
y Azure. El equipo de Thoughtworks ha usado con √©xito la herramienta con varias organizaciones,  incluyendo empresas de tecnolog√≠a energ√©tica, minoristas, proveedores de servicios digitales y 
empresas que utilizan AI. Los proveedores de plataformas en la nube se dan cuenta de que es  importante ayudar a sus clientes a comprender el impacto de carbono del uso de sus servicios, 
por lo que han comenzado a crear una funcionalidad similar por su cuenta. Debido a que CCF es  independiente de la nube, permite a los usuarios ver el uso de energ√≠a y las emisiones de carbono de 
m√∫ltiples proveedores de nube en un solo lugar, al tiempo que muestra las huellas de carbono en un  impacto en el mundo real, como vuelos o √°rboles plantados.
En versiones recientes, CCF comenz√≥ a incluir recomendaciones de optimizaci√≥n de Google Cloud y 
AWS junto con ahorros potenciales de energ√≠a y CO2, as√≠ como para admitir m√°s tipos de instancias  en la nube, como instancias de GPU. Dada la tracci√≥n que ha recibido la herramienta y la adici√≥n 
continua de nuevas caracter√≠sticas, nos sentimos confiados en trasladarla a la versi√≥n de prueba.
Herramientas

Thoughtworks Technology Radar© Thoughtworks, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  

48. Conftest
Probar
Conftest  es una herramienta para escribir pruebas usando datos de configuraci√≥n estructurados. 
Se apoya en el lenguaje Rego  de Open Policy Agent para escribir pruebas de configuraciones de 
Kubernetes  definici√≥n de pipelines de Tekton  o incluso planes de Terraform. Hemos tenido muy 
buenas experiencias con Conftest; y con su f√°cil curva de aprendizaje. Con la rapidez de los tests,  nuestros equipos pueden iterar m√°s r√°pido y seguro cuando hacen cambios de configuraci√≥n de 
Kubernetes.
49. kube-score
Probar kube-score  Es una herramienta que permite realizar an√°lisis de c√≥digo est√°tico de las definiciones 
de objetos Kubernetes. El resultado es una lista de recomendaciones sobre lo que se puede mejorar  para que su aplicaci√≥n sea m√°s segura y resistente. Tiene una lista de verificaciones predefinidas  
que incluye las mejores pr√°cticas, como ejecutar contenedores con privilegios non-root y especificar 
correctamente los l√≠mites de recursos. El kuber-score ha existido durante alg√∫n tiempo y lo hemos  usado en algunos proyectos como parte de un canal CD para los manifiestos de Kubernetes. Un  inconveniente importante de kube-score es que no puede agregar pol√≠ticas personalizadas. 
Normalmente lo complementamos con otras herramientas como Conftest  en estos casos.
50. Lighthouse
Probar
Lighthouse  es una herramienta desarrollada por Google para evaluar aplicaciones y p√°ginas 
web, recolectando m√©tricas de desempe√±o y aprendizajes sobre buenas pr√°cticas de desarrollo.  Desde hace tiempo hemos abogado por las pruebas de desempe√±o como ciudadanos de primera 
categor√≠a , y las actualizaciones a Lighthouse que mencionamos hace cinco a√±os ciertamente 
ayudaron con eso. Nuestro concepto alrededor de funciones de aptitud arquitectural  cre√≥ una 
motivaci√≥n fuerte para tener herramientas como Lighthouse para ser ejecutadas en secuencias 
automatizadas de compilaci√≥n. Con la introducci√≥n de Lighthouse CI , se ha vuelto m√°s f√°cil que 
nunca incluir Lighthouse en secuencias automatizadas de compilaci√≥n administradas por varias 
herramientas .
51. Metaf low
Probar
Metaflow  es una librer√≠a de Python y un servicio de back-end f√°cil de usar que ayuda a los data 
scientists e ingenieros de data a construir y administrar el procesamiento de datos que est√° listo  para producci√≥n, Machine Learning (ML) y flujos de inferencia. Metaflow provee APIs de Python 
que estructuran el c√≥digo como un grafo dirigido de pasos. Cada paso puede ser decorado con 
configuraciones flexibles como los recursos requeridos de procesamiento y de almacenamiento.  Los artefactos de c√≥digo y de data para ejecutar cada uno de los pasos (conocido como tarea) 
est√°n almacenados y pueden ser recuperados ya sea para futuras ejecuciones o para los pr√≥ximos  pasos en el flujo, permiti√©ndole recuperarse de los errores, ejecuciones repetitivas y seguimiento de 
versiones de modelos y sus dependencias a trav√©s de m√∫ltiples ejecuciones.
La propuesta de valor de Metaflow es la simplicidad de la librer√≠a idiom√°tica de Python: se integra 
completamente con la infraestructura construida y con el tiempo de ejecuci√≥n para habilitar la 
ejecuci√≥n de la ingenier√≠a de data y las tareas cient√≠ficas en ambientes de producci√≥n locales

y escalados. Al momento de escribir este art√≠culo, Metaflow se integra fuertemente con los servicios AWS como S3 por su servicio de almacenamiento de data y las funciones de paso para la orquestaci√≥n. Metaflow admite el lenguaje R adem√°s de Python. Sus funcionalidades principales son 
open source.
Si est√°s construyendo y desplegando tu producci√≥n de Machine Learning (ML) y de data-processing  pipelines en AWS, Metaflow es una estructura alterna, ligera y full-stack para plataformas m√°s 
complejas como MLflow .
52. Micrometer
Probar
Micrometer  es una librer√≠a de tipo plataforma-agn√≥stica para la instrumentaci√≥n de m√©tricas en 
la m√°quina virtual de Java (JVM) que soporta Graphite, New Relic, CloudWatch y muchas otras 
integraciones. Hemos encontrado que Micrometer ha beneficiado tanto a autores de librer√≠as 
como a equipos: autores de librer√≠as pueden incluir c√≥digo de instrumentaci√≥n de m√©tricas en sus  librer√≠as sin necesidad de dar soporte a cada uno de los sistemas de m√©tricas que los usuarios est√©n 
utilizando; y los equipos pueden soportar muchos tipos de distintos de m√©tricas en registros de  back-end, lo que permite que las organizaciones colecten m√©tricas de forma consistente.
53. NUKE
Probar
NUKE  es una plataforma de compilaci√≥n para .NET y una alternativa a los tradicionales MSBuild o 
Cake  y Fake  que hemos presentado anteriormente en el Radar. NUKE representa las instrucciones 
de compilaci√≥n como un DSL de C#, lo que lo hace f√°cil de aprender y con un buen soporte de  IDE. En nuestra experiencia, NUKE hizo realmente simple la automatizaci√≥n de la compilaci√≥n de proyectos .NET. Nos gusta la precisi√≥n de las comprobaciones de c√≥digo est√°tico y las sugerencias. 
Tambi√©n nos gusta que podamos utilizar cualquier paquete NuGet sin problemas y que el c√≥digo de  automatizaci√≥n pueda compilarse para evitar problemas en tiempo de ejecuci√≥n. NUKE no es nuevo, pero su novedoso enfoque -utilizando un DSL de C#- y nuestra positiva experiencia en general nos llev√≥ a incluirlo aqu√≠.
54. Pactf low
Probar
Hemos utilizado Pact  para testeo de contratos el tiempo suficiente como para ver parte de la 
complejidad que se produce a escala. Alguno de nuestros equipos han utilizado Pactflow  para 
reducir fricci√≥n. Pactflow se ejecuta tanto como SaaS como una aplicaci√≥n ‚ÄúOn premise‚Äù con la 
misma funcionalidad, y a√±ade usabilidad, seguridad y auditor√≠as mejoradas con respecto a la versi√≥n 
de c√≥digo abierto Pact Broker. Estamos satisfechos con su uso hasta el momento y contentos de ver  un esfuerzo continuado para eliminar parte de la sobrecarga de gestionar el testeo de contratos a 
escala.
55. Podman
Probar
Como una alternativa a Docker , Podman ha sido validada por muchos de nuestros equipos. 
Podman presenta un motor ‚Äúdaemonless‚Äù (sin dependencias de fondo) para el manejo y ejecuci√≥n 
de contenedores, lo que es una acercamiento interesante en comparaci√≥n a lo que Docker hace. 
Adicionalmente, Podman puede ser ejecutado f√°cilmente como un usuario normal sin ser necesario

tener privilegios de administrador, lo que reduce la superficie de ataque. Usando tanto Iniciativas 
Abiertas de Contenedores  (OCI su sigla en ingl√©s) im√°genes construidas por Buildah  o im√°genes 
de Docker, Podman se puede adaptar a la mayor√≠a de los casos de uso de contenedores. Aparte 
de algunos problemas de compatibilidad con macOS, nuestro equipo ha tenido en general buenas 
experiencias con Podman en distribuciones Linux.
56. Grafo de C√≥digo Fuente
Probar
En el anterior Radar, presentamos dos herramientas que se encargaban de la b√∫squeda y el  reemplazo de c√≥digo usando la representaci√≥n de un √°rbol de sintaxis abstracta (AST), Comby  
y Sourcegraph . Si bien estas herramientas comparten ciertas similitudes, estas se diferencian 
de varias maneras. Sourcegraph es una herramienta comercial (con una capa gratuita de hasta 
10-usuarios). Es utilizada particularmente para b√∫squeda, navegaci√≥n y referenciaci√≥n cruzada  entre largas bases de c√≥digo, con √©nfasis en una experiencia de desarrollo interactiva. Por el 
contrario, Comby es una herramienta de l√≠nea de comandos, ligera, de c√≥digo abierto utilizada  para automatizar tareas repetitivas. Debido a que Sourcegraph es un servicio de hosting, tambi√©n 
tiene la capacidad de monitorear continuamente las bases de c√≥digo y enviar alertas cuando una 
coincidencia es encontrada. Ahora que hemos ganado m√°s experiencia con Sourcegraph, decidimos  moverlo al ring de prueba para reflejar nuestra experiencia positiva, lo que no significa que 
Sourcegraph sea mejor que Comby. Cada herramienta se enfoca en un nicho diferente.
57. Syf t
Probar
Uno de los elementos clave para mejorar la ‚Äúseguridad de la cadena de suministro‚Äù es usar una  Lista de materiales de software (SBOM) , por eso es cada vez m√°s importante publicar un SBOM 
junto con el producto de software. Syft  Es una herramienta CLI y una biblioteca Go para generar un 
SBOM a partir de im√°genes de contenedores y sistemas de archivos. Puede generar la salida SBOM  en m√∫ltiples formatos, incluyendo JSON, CycloneDX  y SPDX. La salida SBOM de Syft puede ser 
utilizada por Grype  para el escaneo de vulnerabilidades. Una forma de publicar el SBOM generado 
junto con la imagen es agregarlo como testigo usando Cosign . Esto permite que los consumidores 
de la imagen verifiquen el SBOM y lo utilicen para un an√°lisis posterior.
58. Volta
Probar
Cuando se trabaja con varias bases de c√≥digo JavaScript al mismo tiempo, a menudo es necesario  utilizar diferentes versiones de Node y otras herramientas JavaScript. En los equipos de los 
desarrolladores, estas herramientas generalmente suelen estar instaladas en la cuenta de usuario 
o en la propia m√°quina, lo que significa que se necesita una soluci√≥n para cambiar entre m√∫ltiples  instalaciones. Para Node ya existe nvm , pero queremos destacar Volta  como una alternativa que 
nuestros equipos est√°n usando. Volta tiene varias ventajas sobre nvm: es capaz de gestionar otras 
herramientas de JavaScript como Yarn ; tambi√©n tiene la capacidad de fijar una versi√≥n espec√≠fica 
de la cadena de herramientas en base al proyecto, lo que significa que los desarrolladores pueden 
simplemente utilizar las herramientas en un directorio de c√≥digo dado sin tener que preocuparse de  cambiar manualmente entre versiones: Volta usa shims en la ruta para seleccionar la versi√≥n fijada.  Escrito en Rust, Volta es r√°pido y se distribuye como un binario sin dependencias.

59. Web Test Runner
Probar
Web Test Runner es un paquete dentro del proyecto Modern Web , que proporciona varias 
herramientas de alta calidad para el desarrollo web moderno con soporte para est√°ndares web como 
M√≥dulos ES. Web Test Runner es un ejecutor de pruebas para aplicaciones web. Una de sus ventajas 
en comparaci√≥n con los ejecutores de prueba existentes es que ejecuta pruebas en el navegador 
(que podr√≠a no tener interfaz). Es compatible con m√∫ltiples lanzadores de navegadores, incluidos 
Titiritero , Playwright  y Selenium, y usa Mocha de forma predeterminada para el marco de prueba. 
Las pruebas se ejecutan bastante r√°pido y nos gusta que podamos abrir una ventana del navegador 
con devtools durante la depuraci√≥n. Web Test Runner utiliza internamente Web Dev Server  lo 
que nos permite aprovechar su excelente API de complementos para agregar complementos  personalizados para nuestro conjunto de pruebas. Las herramientas de Modern Web parecen una 
cadena de herramientas para desarrolladores muy prometedora y ya las estamos usando en algunos  proyectos.
60. CDKTF
Evaluar
A estas alturas, muchas organizaciones han creado paisajes extensos de servicios en la nube.  Por supuesto, esto solo es posible cuando se usa infraestructura como c√≥digo  y herramientas 
maduras. Todav√≠a nos gusta Terraform , sobre todo por su rico y creciente ecosistema. Sin embargo, 
la falta de abstracciones en HCL, el lenguaje de configuraci√≥n predeterminado de Terraform, crea 
efectivamente un techo de cristal. El uso de Terragrunt  lo lleva un poco m√°s all√°, pero cada vez 
m√°s, nuestros equipos se encuentran anhelando las abstracciones que ofrecen los lenguajes de 
programaci√≥n modernos. El Kit de desarrollo en la nube para Terraform (CDKTF) , que result√≥ de 
una colaboraci√≥n entre el CDK  de AWS y Hashicorp, hace posible que los equipos utilicen varios 
lenguajes de programaci√≥n, incluidos TypeScript y Java, para definir y aprovisionar la infraestructura. 
Con este enfoque sigue el ejemplo de Pulumi  mientras permanece en el ecosistema Terraform. 
Hemos tenido buenas experiencias con CDKTF, pero hemos decidido mantenerlo en el anillo de 
Evaluaci√≥n hasta que salga de la versi√≥n beta.
61. Chrome Recorder panel
Evaluar
Chrome Recorder panel  es una funci√≥n de vista previa en Google Chrome 97 que permite grabar 
y reproducir de forma sencilla las interacciones de los usuarios. Aunque definitivamente no es una  idea nueva, la forma en que est√° integrada en Chrome permite crear, editar y ejecutar r√°pidamente 
scripts. El panel tambi√©n se integra muy bien con el panel de rendimiento, lo que facilita la obtenci√≥n  de informaci√≥n repetida y coherente sobre el rendimiento de la p√°gina. Aunque las pruebas de 
estilo de grabaci√≥n/reproducci√≥n siempre deben utilizarse con cuidado para evitar pruebas fr√°giles, 
creemos que vale la pena evaluar esta funci√≥n de vista previa, especialmente si ya est√°s utilizando el  panel de rendimiento de Chrome para medir tus p√°ginas.
62. Excalidraw
Evaluar
Excalidraw  es una herramienta de dibujo online, sencilla pero potente, que les encanta utilizar 
a nuestros equipos. A veces, los equipos s√≥lo necesitan una imagen r√°pida y no un diagrama  formal; para los equipos trabajando en remoto, Excalidraw proporciona una forma r√°pida de crear 
y compartir diagramas. A nuestros equipos tambi√©n les gusta el aspecto de ‚Äúbaja fidelidad‚Äù de los 
Herramientas

diagramas que puede generar, que recuerda a los diagramas que habr√≠an dibujado en una pizarra 
si estuvieran trabajando en el mismo lugar. Una advertencia: presta atenci√≥n a la configuraci√≥n de 
seguridad predeterminada, en el momento de escribir, cualquier persona que tenga el enlace puede 
ver el diagrama. La versi√≥n de pago proporciona autenticaci√≥n m√°s avanzada.
63. GitHub Codespaces
Evaluar
GitHub Codespaces  permite a los desarrolladores crear entornos de desarrollo en la nube  y 
acceder a ellos a trav√©s de un IDE como si el entorno fuera local. GitHub no es la primera empresa en  implementar esta idea; anteriormente hablamos sobre Gitpod . Nos gusta que Codespaces permite 
que los entornos se estandarizan mediante el uso de archivos de configuraci√≥n, lo que agiliza la  incorporaci√≥n de nuevos miembros al equipo, y que ofrecen m√°quinas virtuales con hasta 32 n√∫cleos 
y 64 GB de memoria. Estas m√°quinas virtuales se pueden activar en menos de diez segundos, lo que  ofrece potencialmente entornos m√°s potentes que una computadora port√°til de desarrollo.
64. GoReleaser
Evaluar
GoReleaser  es una herramienta que automatiza el proceso de construcci√≥n y liberaci√≥n de 
un proyecto Go para diferentes arquitecturas a trav√©s de m√∫ltiples repositorios y canales, una  necesidad com√∫n para los proyectos Go dirigidos a diferentes plataformas. La herramienta se 
ejecuta desde la m√°quina local a trav√©s de CI, con la herramienta disponible a trav√©s de varios 
servicios de CI, minimizando as√≠ la configuraci√≥n y el mantenimiento. GoReleaser se encarga de  construir, empaquetar, publicar y anunciar cada versi√≥n y soporta diferentes combinaciones de  formato de paquete, repositorio de paquetes y control de fuentes. Aunque existe desde hace unos 
a√±os, nos sorprende que no haya m√°s equipos que lo utilicen. Si est√°s lanzando regularmente una  base de c√≥digo Go, vale la pena evaluar esta herramienta.
65. Grype
Evaluar
Asegurar la cadena de suministro de software se ha convertido en una preocupaci√≥n habitual  entre los equipos de entrega, una preocupaci√≥n que se refleja en el creciente n√∫mero de nuevas herramientas en este espacio. Grype  es una nueva y ligera herramienta de exploraci√≥n de 
vulnerabilidades para im√°genes Docker y OCI. Esta herramienta puede ser instalada como un binario,  puede escanear im√°genes antes de que sean subidas a un registro docker, y no requiere un demonio 
Docker para ejecutarse en los agentes de construcci√≥n. Grype proviene del mismo equipo que est√° 
detr√°s de Syft , el cual genera SBOMs  en varios formatos a partir de im√°genes de contenedores. 
Grype puede consumir la salida SBOM de Syft para escanearla en busca de vulnerabilidades.
66. Infracost
Evaluar
Una de las ventajas que se mencionan frecuentemente cuando se habla de moverse hacia la nube 
es la transparencia alrededor del coste de infraestructura. En nuestra experiencia, no siempre se da 
este caso. Los equipos no siempre piensan en las decisiones que toman en torno a la infraestructura 
en t√©rminos de coste financiero, y es por ello que ya mencionamos con anterioridad √©l coste de 
ejecuci√≥n como funci√≥n de aptitud de arquitectura . Tenemos curiosidad por el lanzamiento de una 
nueva herramienta llamada Infracost  que se propone dar visibilidad a los compromisos de coste en 
Herramientas

las pull request en Terraform. Es un software de c√≥digo abierto y est√° disponible para macOS, Linux, 
Windows y Docker y muestra los precios para AWS, GCP y Microsoft Azure listos para usar. Tambi√©n  proporciona una API p√∫blica que puede ser consultada para conocer los datos de coste actualizados. 
Nuestros equipos est√°n entusiasmados con su potencial, especialmente cuando se trata de ganar  mejor visibilidad en los costes en el IDE (Entorno de desarrollo integrado).
67. jc
Evaluar
En el Radar anterior, colocamos Modern Unix Commands  c√≥mo tecnolog√≠a a evaluar. Uno de los 
comandos presentes en esa colecci√≥n de herramientas era jq, un sed (stream editor) para JSON. jc  
realiza una tarea similar: recoge la salida de comandos de Unix habituales y la convierte a formato 
JSON. Los dos comandos juntos ofrecen un puente entre el mundo de Unix CLI y el conjunto de  librer√≠as y herramientas que funcionan con JSON. Al escribir scripts simples, por ejemplo, para 
el despliegue de software o la obtenci√≥n de informaci√≥n de diagn√≥stico, tener toda una gama 
de formatos de salida de diferentes comandos Unix mapeados a un formato JSON bien definido  puede ahorrarnos mucho tiempo y esfuerzo. Al igual que con jq, es necesario asegurarse de que el 
comando est√° disponible. Puede ser instalado desde muchos de los repositorios m√°s conocidos.
68. skopeo
Evaluar
skopeo  es una utilidad de l√≠nea de comando que realiza varias operaciones sobre im√°genes de 
contenedores y repositorios de im√°genes. No requiere que un usuario sea administrador para realizar  la mayor√≠a de sus operaciones ni precisa de un demonio para ejecutarse. Es una parte √∫til del pipeline 
de integraci√≥n continua; lo hemos utilizado para copiar im√°genes de un registro a otro a medida que se  promov√≠an las im√°genes. Es mejor que realizar un ‚Äúpull‚Äù y un ‚Äúpush‚Äù ya que no es necesario almacenar las im√°genes localmente. No es una herramienta nueva, pero es suficientemente √∫til y poco utilizada 
por lo que pensamos que vale la pena mencionarla.
69. SQLFluff
Evaluar
Si bien el linting (el an√°lisis est√°tico del c√≥digo fuente) es una pr√°ctica antigua en el mundo del  software, su adopci√≥n en el mundo de los datos ha sido m√°s lenta. SQLFluff  es un linter (herramienta 
para hacer linting) SQL de dialecto cruzado escrito en Python, que se lanza a trav√©s de l√≠nea de 
comandos (CLI), lo que hace que sea f√°cil incorporarlo en las pipelines de CI/CD. Si est√°s c√≥modo 
con las convenciones predeterminadas, entonces SQLFluff trabaja sin ninguna otra configuraci√≥n 
adicional despu√©s de instalarlo, imponiendo un conjunto de est√°ndares de formato fuertemente  definidos; establecer tus propias convenciones requiere a√±adir un fichero de configuraci√≥n. La  interfaz por l√≠nea de comandos (CLI) puede corregir autom√°ticamente ciertos tipos de violaciones 
que incluyen problemas de formato como los espacios en blanco o las may√∫sculas en las palabras 
clave. SQLFluff es todav√≠a nuevo, pero estamos emocionados por ver a SQL tener m√°s presencia en 
el mundo del linting.

70. Validador de Terraform
Evaluar
Las organizaciones que han adoptado infraestructura como c√≥digo  y plataformas de infraestructura 
de autoservicio est√°n buscando formas de brindar a los equipos la m√°xima autonom√≠a mientras se  mantienen aplicando buenas pr√°cticas de seguridad y pol√≠ticas organizacionales. Hemos resaltado 
tfsec  before and are moving it into the Adopt category in this Radar. For teams working on GCP, 
Terraform Validator  antes y lo estamos moviendo a la categor√≠a Adoptar en este Radar. Para los 
equipos que trabajan en GCP, Terraform Validator podr√≠a ser una opci√≥n al crear una biblioteca de  pol√≠ticas, un conjunto de restricciones que se comparan contra las configuraciones de Terraform.
71. Typesense
Evaluar
Typesense  Es un motor de b√∫squeda de texto r√°pido y tolerante a errores tipogr√°ficos. Para casos 
de uso con grandes vol√∫menes de datos, Elasticsearch podr√≠a seguir siendo una buena opci√≥n, ya 
que proporciona una soluci√≥n de b√∫squeda horizontalmente escalable basada en disco. Sin embargo, 
si est√°s construyendo una aplicaci√≥n de b√∫squeda sensible a la latencia con un tama√±o de √≠ndice  de b√∫squeda que puede caber en memoria, Typesense es una alternativa poderosa y otra opci√≥n a 
evaluar junto a herramientas como Meilisearch .

72. SwiftUI
AdoptarCuando Apple present√≥ SwiftUI  hace unos a√±os, fue un gran paso para la implementaci√≥n de 
interfaces de usuario en todo tipo de dispositivos fabricados por Apple. Desde el principio, nos gust√≥ 
el enfoque declarativo, centrado en el c√≥digo y el modelo de programaci√≥n reactiva proporcionado  por Combine . Sin embargo, nos dimos cuenta de que escribir muchas pruebas de vista, que todav√≠a 
se necesitan con un patr√≥n modelo-vista-modelovista (MVVM), no se alineaba realmente con el  marco de automatizaci√≥n XCUITest proporcionado por Apple. Esta brecha ha sido cerrada por 
ViewInspector . Un √∫ltimo obst√°culo era la versi√≥n m√≠nima del sistema operativo requerida. En el 
momento del lanzamiento, s√≥lo las √∫ltimas versiones de iOS y macOS pod√≠an ejecutar aplicaciones 
escritas con SwiftUI, pero debido a la cadencia regular de actualizaciones de Apple, las aplicaciones 
de SwiftUI ahora pueden ejecutarse en pr√°cticamente todas las versiones de macOS y iOS que  reciben actualizaciones de seguridad.
73. Testcontainers
Adoptar
Tenemos suficiente experiencia en el uso de Testcontainers  sobre la cual creemos que es por 
defecto la opci√≥n m√°s adecuada para crear entornos confiables para la ejecuci√≥n de pruebas.  Es una librer√≠a que se puede usar en m√∫ltiples lenguajes , y dockeriza las librer√≠as de test m√°s 
comunes (incluyendo varios tipos de bases de datos, tecnolog√≠as de encolamiento, servicios en  la nube y dependencias de UI testing como navegadores) con la habilidad de ejecutar Dockerfiles 
personalizados cuando sea necesario. Funciona bien en frameworks de testeo como JUnit, es 
suficientemente flexible como para dejar que los usuarios gestionen el ciclo de vida y la conexiones  de red de los contenedores para que r√°pidamente tengan seteado un entorno integrado de pruebas.  Nuestros equipos la encuentran como una librer√≠a programable, ligera y una manera f√°cil de manejar 
contenedores para hacer de sus tests a√∫n m√°s confiables.
74. Bob
Probar
Cuando se construye una aplicaci√≥n con React Native, a veces nos vemos en la necesidad de crear  nuestros propios m√≥dulos. Por ejemplo, nos hemos encontrado con esta necesidad de crear una librer√≠a de componentes de UI para una aplicaci√≥n React Native. Desarrollar m√≥dulos no es tan 
sencillo pero nuestros equipos han demostrado solvencia usando Bob  para automatizar esta tarea. 
Bob proporciona una CLI para crear el andamiaje (scaffolding) para diferentes tipos de proyectos. 
El andamiaje no se limita a la funcionalidad base, sino que, opcionalmente, puede incluir c√≥digo de 
ejemplo, linters, configuraciones de pipelines de construcci√≥n, etc.
75. Widget de Flutter-Unity 
Probar
Flutter es cada vez m√°s popular para crear aplicaciones m√≥viles multiplataforma, y    Unity es 
excelente para crear experiencias AR/VR. Una pieza clave en el rompecabezas para integrar  Unity y Flutter es el widget de Flutter-Unity , que permite incorporar aplicaciones de Unity dentro 
de aplicaciones Flutter. Una de las capacidades clave que ofrece el widget es la comunicaci√≥n  bidireccional entre Flutter y Unity. Hemos encontrado que su rendimiento tambi√©n es bastante 
bueno, y esperamos aprovechar Unity en m√°s aplicaciones de Flutter.

76. Kotest 
Probar
Kotest  (anteriormente llamado Kotlin Test) es una herramienta de testing independiente para 
el  Kotlin  ecosistema que continua ganando fuerza entre nuestros equipos a trav√©s de varias 
implementaciones de Kotlin - nativo, JVM o JavaScript. Las principales ventajas son que ofrece 
una gran variedad de estilos de testing para organizar los test suites y que viene con un amplio y 
completo conjunto de matchers, los cuales permiten tests ‚Äòexpresivos‚Äô conjuntamente con una DSL  interna elegante. Adem√°s de su soporte para property-based testing  ‚Äî una t√©cnica que hemos 
destacado previamente en el Radar ‚Äì a nuestros equipos les gusta el s√≥lido plugin de IntelliJ y la 
creciente comunidad de soporte al rededor.
77. Swift Package Manager
Probar
Algunos lenguajes de programaci√≥n, especialmente los m√°s nuevos, tienen una soluci√≥n integrada  para administraci√≥n de paquetes y dependencias. Cuando fue presentado en 2014, Swift no ven√≠a 
con un administrador de paquetes, y entonces la comunidad de desarrolladores para macOS y  iOS simplemente continu√≥ usando CocoaPods y Carthage , tlas soluciones de terceros que hab√≠an 
sido creadas para Objective-C. Un par de a√±os m√°s tarde Swift Package Manager  ((SwiftPM) fue 
iniciado como un proyecto de c√≥digo abierto oficial de Apple, y entonces tom√≥ unos pocos a√±os 
m√°s antes que Apple pudiera a√±adir su soporte para Xcode. Incluso en ese punto, muchos equipos 
de desarrollo continuaban usando CocoaPods y Carthage, en su mayor√≠a porque muchos paquetes 
simplemente no estaban disponibles a trav√©s de SwiftPM. Ahora que la mayor√≠a de los paquetes  pueden ser a√±adidos a trav√©s de SwiftPM y los procesos han sido simplificados tanto para creadores 
como consumidores de los paquetes, nuestros equipos est√°n confiando cada vez m√°s en SwiftPM.
78. Vowpal Wabbit 
Probar
Vowpal Wabbit  es una una librer√≠a de uso general para aprendizaje autom√°tico (machine learning). 
Fue creada originalmente por Yahoo! Research hace m√°s de una d√©cada, Vowpal Wabbit sigue  implementando nuevos algoritmos de refuerzo del aprendizaje. Queremos resaltar que Vowpal 
Wabbit 9.0 , ha publicado una nueva versi√≥n importante despu√©s de seis a√±os, y alentarlos a 
planear la migraci√≥n  ya que tiene varias mejoras de usabilidad, nuevas reducciones y arregla varios 
defectos.
79. Android Gradle plugin - Kotlin DSL
Evaluar
Android Gradle plugin Kotlin DSL ha agregado soporte para Kotlin Script como alternativa a  Groovy para los scripts de compilaci√≥n de Gradle. El objetivo de reemplazar Groovy con Kotlin es proporcionar un mejor soporte para la refactorizaci√≥n y una edici√≥n m√°s simple en los IDE (Entorno 
de desarrollo integrado) y, en √∫ltima instancia, producir c√≥digo que sea m√°s f√°cil de leer y mantener.  Para equipos que ya usan Kotlin, tambi√©n significa trabajar en la compilaci√≥n en un lenguaje familiar. 
Hemos tenido un equipo con un script de compilaci√≥n de 450 l√≠neas de al menos siete a√±os de 
antig√ºedad que migr√≥  en unos pocos d√≠as. Si tienen scripts de compilaci√≥n de Gradle grandes o 
complejos, entonces vale la pena evaluar si Kotlin Script producir√° mejores resultados para sus 
equipos.

80. Azure Bicep  
Evaluar
Para aquellos que prefieren un lenguaje m√°s natural que JSON para c√≥digo de infraestructura, Azure 
Bicep  es un lenguaje espec√≠fico de dominio (DSL) que utiliza una sintaxis declarativa. Soporta 
plantillas parametrizadas reutilizables para definiciones de recursos modulares. Una extensi√≥n de 
Visual Studio Code proporciona seguridad de tipo instant√°nea, intellisense y verificaci√≥n de sintaxis,  y el compilador permite la transpilaci√≥n bidireccional hacia y desde plantillas ARM. El DSL orientado a recursos de Bicep y la integraci√≥n nativa con el ecosistema de Azure lo convierten en una opci√≥n convincente para el desarrollo de infraestructura de Azure.
81. Capacitor
Evaluar
Hemos estado discutiendo los m√©ritos de las herramientas de desarrollo m√≥vil multi-plataforma 
tanto tiempo como el que hemos llevado publicando el Radar Tecnol√≥gico. En 2011, nos dimos 
cuenta por primera vez de una nueva generaci√≥n de herramientas cuando creamos el blip sobre  plataformas multi-dispositivo . Aunque permanecimos esc√©pticos al principio, estas herramientas 
se han perfeccionado y han sido adoptadas ampliamente a lo largo de los a√±os. Y nadie puede  discutir la popularidad duradera y la utilidad de React Native . Capacitor es la √∫ltima generaci√≥n 
de una l√≠nea de herramientas que comenz√≥ con PhoneGap, y luego fue renombrada a Apache 
Cordova . Capacitor es una reescritura completa de Ionic que abraza el estilo de las aplicaciones 
web progresivas  para aplicaciones independientes. Hasta ahora, a nuestras desarrolladoras les 
gusta que pueden conseguir crear aplicaciones web, iOS y Android con una √∫nica base de c√≥digo y 
que pueden gestionar las plataformas nativas de forma separada con acceso a APIs nativas cuando 
es necesario. Capacitor ofrece una alternativa a React Native, que tiene muchos a√±os de experiencia  multi-plataforma a sus espaldas.
82. Java 17  
Evaluar
No solemos presentar nuevas versiones de lenguajes de forma rutinaria, pero quer√≠amos destacar  la nueva versi√≥n de soporte a largo plazo (LTS) de Java, la versi√≥n 17. Si bien hay nuevas funciones 
prometedoras, como la vista previa de b√∫squeda de patrones , es el cambio al nuevo proceso de 
LTS lo que deber√≠a interesar a muchas organizaciones. Recomendamos a las organizaciones que 
eval√∫en nuevas versiones de Java a medida que est√©n disponibles, asegur√°ndose de adoptar nuevas  funciones y versiones seg√∫n convenga. Sorprendentemente, muchas organizaciones no adoptan  nuevas versiones de lenguajes de manera rutinaria, a pesar de que las actualizaciones peri√≥dicas 
ayudan a mantener las cosas peque√±as y manejables. Con suerte, el nuevo proceso de LTS, junto  con las organizaciones pasando a hacer actualizaciones peri√≥dicas, ayudar√° a evitar la trampa de 
‚Äúdemasiado caro actualizar‚Äù que acaba con el software de producci√≥n ejecut√°ndose en una versi√≥n  de Java al final de su vida √∫til.
83. Jetpack Glance 
Evaluar
Android 12 ha tra√≠do cambios significativos en los widgets de las aplicaciones, las cuales han  mejorado la experiencia del usuario final y del desarrollador. Para realizar aplicaciones de Android, 
hemos expresado nuestra preferencia por Jetpack Compose  como una forma moderna de construir 
interfaces de usuario nativas. Ahora, con Jetpack Glance , el cual es construido sobre el Compose 
runtime, los desarrolladores pueden usar similares APIs declarativas de Kotlin para escribir widgets.

84. Jetpack Media3  
Evaluar
Hoy en d√≠a, Android tiene una gran variedad de APIs: Jetpack Media, tambi√©n conocido como 
MediaCompat, JetpackMedia2 y ExoPlayer. Desafortunadamente, estas bibliotecas fueron 
desarrolladas independientemente, con distintos objetivos que sobreponen funcionalidades. Las  personas que desarrollan con Android no solamente ten√≠an que escoger qu√© biblioteca usar, sino 
que tambi√©n ten√≠an que encargarse de hacer adaptadores u otras medidas para poder usar distintas  bibliotecas a la vez. Jetpack Media3  es un esfuerzo, actualmente en acceso anticipado, de crear 
una nueva API que contiene las funcionalidades comunes de las APIs que ya existen (incluyendo  interfaz de usuario, playback y manejo de sesiones de multimedia) conbin√°ndolas para crear una 
unida y refinada API. La interfaz de ExoPlayer tambi√©n ha sido actualizada, mejorada y simplificada  para ejercer como interfaz com√∫n para Media3.
85. MistQL
Evaluar
MistQL  es un peque√±o lenguaje espec√≠fico de dominio que sirve para hacer c√°lculos en estructuras 
similares a JSON. Originalmente construido para la extracci√≥n manual de funcionalidades de  modelos de machine learning en front end, MistQL actualmente soporta una implementaci√≥n en 
JavaScript para navegadores y una implementaci√≥n en Python para casos de uso del lado del  servidor. Nos gusta su limpia sintaxis componible y funcional. Animamos a evaluarlo bas√°ndose en 
sus necesidades.
86. npm workspaces 
Evaluar
Mientras que muchas herramientas se pueden usar en el mundo de desarrollo multipaquete de node. js, npm 7 a√±ade soporte directo con npm workspaces . Gestionar paquetes relacionados en conjunto 
facilita el desarrollo, permiti√©ndote, por ejemplo, guardar multiples librer√≠as relacionadas en un solo  repositorio. Con npm workspaces, una vez hayas a√±adido una configuraci√≥n en un package.json de 
alto nivel que haga referencia a uno o m√°s archivos de package.json anidados, comandos como npm  install trabajar√°n a trav√©s de multiples paquetes, enlazando simb√≥licamente los paquetes fuente 
dependientes en el directorio ra√≠z node_modules. Otros comandos tambi√©n estar√°n al tanto de los  workspaces, permiti√©ndote, por ejemplo, ejecutar los comandos npm run y npm test a trav√©s de  m√∫ltiples paquetes con un solo comando. Tener esta flexibilidad desde el primer momento reduce la 
necesidad de algunos equipos de llegar a usar otro gestor de paquetes.
87. Remix
Evaluar
Hemos sido testigos de la migraci√≥n de renderizar sitios web desde el lado del servidor a una 
aplicaci√≥n de una sola p√°gina dentro del navegador, ahora el p√©ndulo del desarrollo web parece  balancearse al medio de todo. Remix es uno de estos ejemplos. Es un framework fullstack para JavaScript. El framework provee una carga r√°pida para las p√°ginas utilizando sistemas 
distribuidos y navegadores nativos en lugar de compilaciones est√°ticas ineficientes. Ha logrado 
algunas optimizaciones en enrutamientos anidados y en la carga de p√°ginas, lo que hace que  la representaci√≥n de la p√°gina parezca especialmente r√°pida. Mucha gente comparar√° Remix 
con  Next.js , que est√° similarmente posicionada. Nos complace ver a este framework combinar 
ingeniosamente el tiempo de ejecuci√≥n del navegador con el tiempo de ejecuci√≥n del servidor

88. ShedLock 
Evaluar
Ejecutar una tarea programada una √∫nica vez en un cluster de procesadores distribuidos es un  requerimiento relativamente com√∫n. Por ejemplo, la situaci√≥n podr√≠a surgir cuando se ingesta un lote 
de datos, se env√≠a una notificaci√≥n o se ejecuta alguna actividad de limpieza peri√≥dica. Pero, este es  un problema notablemente complicado. ¬øC√≥mo es que un grupo de procesos cooperan de manera 
segura sobre redes lentas y poco confiables? Alg√∫n mecanismo de bloqueo es necesario para  coordinar las acciones a trav√©s del cluster. Afortunadamente, una variedad de almacenamientos 
distribuidos pueden implementar un bloqueo. Sistemas como  ZooKeeper  y Consul, as√≠ como 
tambi√©n bases de datos como DynamoDB o Couchbase  poseen mecanismos subyacentes para 
administrar el consenso dentro del cluster. ShedLock  es una peque√±a biblioteca para aprovecharse 
de estos proveedores en tu c√≥digo Java, si est√°s buscando implementar tus propias tareas  programadas. Cuenta con un API para adquirir y liberar bloqueos, as√≠ como tambi√©n conectores para 
una amplia variedad de proveedores de bloqueo. Si est√°s escribiendo tus propias tareas distribuidas  pero quieres evitar la complejidad que implica una plataforma de orquestaci√≥n como Kubernetes , 
vale la pena darle un vistazo a ShedLock.
89. SpiceDB
Evaluar
SpiceDB  es un sistema de base de datos inspirado en Zanzibar , (creado por Google), para gestionar 
permisos en aplicaciones. Con SpiceDB, defines un esquema para modelar los requisitos y usas el 
cliente  para aplicar el esquema a una de las base de datos soportadas , insertar permisos o pedir 
respuesta a preguntas del tipo ‚Äú¬øTiene este usuario acceso a este rescurso?‚Äù o incluso al rev√©s 
‚Äú¬øCuales son todos los recursos a los que este usuario tiene acceso?‚Äù Normalmente abogamos por la  separaci√≥n de las reglas de autorizaci√≥n y el c√≥digo, pero SpiceDB va un paso m√°s all√° separando los recursos y las reglas almacenando como un grafo para responder eficientemente a consultas 
sobre autorizaci√≥n. Debido a esta separaci√≥n, debes asegurarte que los cambios en los datos de  tu aplicaci√≥n principal se vean reflejados en SpiceDB. Entre otras implementaciones inspiradas en 
Zanzibar, creemos que SpiceDB es una herramienta a valorar para gestionar autorizaciones en tu  aplicaci√≥n.
90. sqlc 
Evaluar
sqlc  es un compilador que genera c√≥digo Go idiom√°tico y con seguridad de tipos a partir de 
SQL. A diferencia de otros enfoques basados en un mapeo objeto-relacional (ORM), puedes  seguir escribiendo sencillamente SQL para lo que necesites. Una vez invocado, sqlc comprueba la correcci√≥n del SQL y genera un c√≥digo Go eficiente, que puede ser llamado directamente desde el  resto de la aplicaci√≥n. Con un soporte estable tanto para PostgreSQL como MySQL, merece la pena 
echarle un vistazo a sqlc y te animamos a que lo pruebes.

Evaluar
Zig  es un nuevo lenguaje que comparte muchos atributos con C pero con un tipado m√°s fuerte, 
asignaci√≥n de memoria m√°s f√°cil, soporte para espacios de nombres y una serie de otras  caracter√≠sticas. Su sintaxis, sin embargo, recuerda a JavaScript m√°s que a C, lo que algunos pueden  reprocharle. El objetivo de Zig es proporcionar un lenguaje muy simple con una compilaci√≥n sencilla 
que minimice efectos laterales y produzca una ejecuci√≥n predecible y f√°cil de seguir. Zig tambi√©n  proporciona acceso a la capacidad de compilaci√≥n cruzada . de LLVM. Algunas de nuestras 
desarrolladoras han encontrado esta caracter√≠stica tan √∫til, que est√°n utilizando Zig como un 
compilador cruzado incluso aunque no est√©n escribiendo c√≥digo en Zig. Zig es un lenguaje novedoso 
e interesante de investigar para aplicaciones donde C est√° siendo considerado o ya est√° en uso, as√≠ 
como para aplicaciones de sistema de bajo nivel que requieren manipulaci√≥n expl√≠cita de memoria.

After 10 Years, AWS continues 	 	
to expand Amazon DynamoDB 
well beyond scalability
February 24 2022
by James Curtis
DynamoDB started with a focus on scalability, but over the past 10 years, this 
nonrelational cloud database service has matured significantly, with AWS adding 
capabilities like usability, manageability and extensibility, targeting a variety of enterprise 
operational workloads and serving hundreds of thousands of customers.

Introduction
When AWS rolled out Amazon DynamoDB in 2012 as a managed cloud database service, it was to address several 
challenges the company had seen with traditional relational databases, particularly around scaling. After 10 
years, AWS continues to iterate on this nonrelational (NoSQL) database service, having previously added or 
enhanced support for ACID transactions, replication, streaming and on-demand pricing, as just a few examples.
AWS added several enhancements throughout 2021, including capabilities for improved client-side application 
development and improved support for SQL-like querying, as well as broader integration with AWS services such 
as Amazon S3 storage and Amazon Kinesis streaming. At re:Invent 2021, the company introduced flexible table 
storage pricing and integration with AWS Backup.
THE TAKE
A decade after its introduction, Amazon DynamoDB can be considered a trailblazer in the managed 
cloud database space, a sector that began to emerge around 2008. While DynamoDB has been known 
as a purpose-built service since inception, it‚Äôs now moving into general-purpose territory, particularly 
as the scope of the service has broadened to cater to SQL developers to address a wide array of 
operational workloads. DynamoDB is a mature cloud database service, but there is still room to grow 
as it looks to tap into the wide array of AWS services. This approach will be necessary to differentiate 
the offering from a growing cadre of database services, many of which pinpoint serverless and scaling.
Context
Early on, DynamoDB played the role of relational database disruptor, with a focus on scaling operational 
transactions and doing it with a NoSQL data model as a fully managed cloud service. Amazon DynamoDB was 
serverless from the get-go, which is noteworthy because database vendors are now rushing to add serverless 
as core functionality to their cloud database offerings to meet customer demand. Based on 451 451 Research‚Äôs 
Voice of the Enterprise: Data, AI, and Analytics, Data Analytics, Data Platforms survey, 62% of respondents report 
that their organizations are either using serverless, or have plans to adopt the technology in the near term.
The 10-year anniversary of the service is noteworthy ‚Äì DynamoDB was released as a fully managed serverless 
cloud database long before serverless was an industry catchword for scaling cloud infrastructure on demand. 
The impetus behind DynamoDB was to address several challenges that Amazon had experienced with traditional 
relational databases around scaling in a production environment.
Although DynamoDB‚Äôs release appeared as a quick answer to its relational database challenges, the company 
had been chewing on the principles of a highly distributed, scalable and durable NoSQL database for some time. 
These principles were spelled out in a 2007 technical paper written by AWS engineers on Amazon‚Äôs Dynamo 
internal technology.
Fast forward to 2012, when AWS released DynamoDB as a fully managed NoSQL cloud database service, which 
specifically utilizes a key-value data model that supports a document model. In database speak, DynamoDB is a 
multimodel NoSQL database.

Technology updates
DynamoDB is considered a mature database cloud service. A few noteworthy additions from prior updates 
include support for ACID transactions, active-active global replication, on-demand and point-in-time restore, 
streaming and on-demand pricing. Significant AWS services integrations include Key Management Service 
for encrypting data rest, and CloudWatch Contributor Insights ‚Äì an AWS service for gaining insights on access 
patterns, tagging, VPN endpoints and triggers. In 2021, the company made further updates that touch on areas 
such as usability, manageability and extensibility.
Regarding usability, AWS added the NoSQL Workbench, consisting of a client-side, cross-platform IDE tool that 
provides data modeling, data visualizing and query devolvement for client-side developers. AWS also announced 
support for PartiQL ‚Äì compatible with the NoSQL Workbench, the SQL-capability query language enables 
developers to interact with DynamoDB using common SQL commands.
For manageability, DynamoDB now supports AWS CloudTrail to manage governance, compliance and risk 
auditing on AWS accounts. Meanwhile, at re:Invent 2021, it announced the Amazon DynamoDB Standard-
Infrequent Access table class that provides flexible table storage pricing. This new capability targets storage-
heavy workloads in which infrequently accessed tables can be identified for lower storage costs. Customers still 
pay for throughput (to maintain consistent performance), but the throughput costs are offset by lower storage 
costs, potentially up to 60% over Standard Access tables, according to AWS.
On the integration front, AWS announced DynamoDB integration with AWS Backup, a centralized automatic 
backup service. Previously, customers had to carry out backup processes on a case-by-case basis, depending 
on the database service. With AWS Backup, however, users can manage backup policies across their AWS 
database services from a single management plane. Additionally, there is now integration with Amazon Kinesis, 
specifically the Kinesis Data Streams capabilities that capture item-level changes in the form of a data stream 
to DynamoDB tables.
Competition
DynamoDB‚Äôs customer appeal centers on its ability to scale a high number of operational transactions while 
maintaining performance. Sometimes referred to as ‚Äòperformance at scale,‚Äô this approach has traditionally been 
the sweet spot for NoSQL databases. As a managed cloud service that employs a key-value data and document 
data model, DynamoDB primarily competes directly with peer cloud platform providers serving up the same or 
similar data model.
Given this, competitors include Azure Cosmos DB and Google‚Äôs Datastore, available on Azure and GCP cloud 
platforms, respectively. There is also Oracle NoSQL Database and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database, which 
reside on Oracle‚Äôs cloud platform, while IBM has its Cloudant NoSQL database offered on IBM Cloud. Couchbase 
Capella and MongoDB Atlas are available on multiple cloud platforms and are worthy competitors, as is Redis 
Enterprise Cloud.
However, an emerging category of databases referred to as distributed SQL concentrates on handling 
operational transactions in a highly geo-distributed environment. Many of these vendors are peddling more 
traditional relational data models, although some are blending relational and nonrelational. Regardless, 
potential competitors include Cockroach Labs, PlanetScale, YugaByte, Fauna, MariaDB Xpand, AWS Amazon 
Aurora, Google Cloud Spanner, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL-Hyperscale, SingleStore and PingCAP.

SWOT Analysis
STRENGTHS
Since its inception, DynamoDB has been serverless 
and provided performance at scale, which turned 
out to be a crucial design choice ‚Äì particularly given 
the increased demand for serverless database 
architectures today.	
WEAKNESSES
As a NoSQL database, DynamoDB won‚Äôt match the 
full spectrum of SQL querying capabilities offered 
by relational database systems, although that gap 
seems to be slowly closing.	
OPPORTUNITIES
Although DynamoDB can be considered a maturing 
cloud database service now, there is certainly 
room to grow as it aims to tap into a wide array of 
AWS services, which will certainly be necessary 
to differentiate from a growing cadre of database 
services.	
THREATS
Serverless and scalability are becoming less 
distinguishable feature, since many existing 
vendors and new emerging vendors are rolling out 
serverless architectures and focusing specifically 
on SQL scaling capabilities.

Rebranding	¬†Announcement	
From	 release	 7.0.0	 and	 onward,	 the	 VTE	 (Vormetric	 Transparent	 Encryption)	 Agent	 had	 been	 rebranded	 to	 CTE	 (CipherTrust	 Transparent	 Encryption)	 Agent. 	 When	 a host	 is 	
registered	 with	 the	 DSM	 key	 manager,	 CTE	 is backward	 compatible	 with	 the	 VTE	 Agent	 when	 it comes	 to	 supported	 kernel	 platforms,	 applications,	 and	 configurations.	 For	 	
example,	 if a given	 kernel	 is supported	 starting	 with	 VTE	 6.3.0.130,	 it is automatically	 supported	 in	 all	 CTE	 releases	 as	 well.	 	
For	 information	 about	 VTE	 release	 support,	 see	 the	 Vormetric	 Transparent	 Encryption	 Agent	 Compatibility	 Matrix,	 Release	 6.3.1	.

GoldenGate Augments Cloud Databases 	
GoldenGate Augments Cloud 
Databases 	
by, David Floyer 	
May 21st, 2021 
Oracle GoldenGate is now offered as an integral part of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which dramatically 
lowers the costs of provisioning and maintaining the GoldenGate advanced features for all the Database 
Platforms supported. Previous Wikibon research established that Convergence & Distribution are important 
dimensions of any Cloud Database. 
Wikibon strongly recommends that senior enterprise executives focus intently on the development of Cloud 
Database Platforms, which are fully converged and excel across both transactional and analytic data types. The 
converged database must also support Data Mesh features and allow distributions of data where the data is 
created and the ability of lines of business to work directly and own the data that is vital to them. They will 
radically improve the cost, time-to-value, and functionality when used to implement data-driven strategies.

GoldenGate Augments Cloud Databases 	
Premise 
Oracle  GoldenGate  is now  offered  as an  integral  part of Oracle  Cloud Infrastructure  (OCI), which 
dramatically  lowers the costs  of provisioning  and maintaining  the GoldenGate  advanced features for all the
Database  Platforms supported.  Previous Wikibon research  established  that Convergence  & Distribution  (see 
the  section  below for definitions)  are important  dimensions  of any  Cloud  Database  Platform. 
The  premise  of this  research  is that  GoldenGate  improves the convergence-dimension  and significantly
improves  the distribution-dimension  for all the  Cloud  Database  Platforms that GoldenGate  supports. As a 
result,  GoldenGate  improves the integration  between different databases  and significantly  reduces 
database  conversion. 
Scope of this  Research 
This  research  adds the impact  of GoldenGate  on the  Oracle  Cloud Database  Platform and adds  SAP HANA
into  the earlier  research  titled ‚ÄúCloud  Database  Platform Positioning,‚Äù  published February, 19th 2021.  The 
research  has also  been  updated  with additional  changes and feedback  from the community. 
GoldenGate  101 
The explosion  of Databases 
Databases  were originally  for systems  of record  (transactional  databases) and analytic  systems  (data 
warehouse  databases).  In the  last  decade,  enterprises  have deployed  many new databases,  such as NoSQL,
log,  graph  databases,  and many  others.  Wikibon  would point out that  the reason  for these  database  types 
is  the  emergence  of new  data  types.  Log files  have  very different  characteristics  and processing
requirements  from systems  of record.  Splunk is a very  effective  log database. 
The  increase  in data  types  is continuing.  Blockchain,  machine learning,  and inference  data types  are the 
newest,  and Wikibon  expects this trend  to continue  developing. 
Changing  Enterprise  Database Strategy 
As a result  of the  increases  in data  types,  most enterprises  have business-critical  data distributed  across 
the  enterprise  in heterogeneous  databases. However, enterprise  system designers  are increasingly
focusing  on simplifying  and automating  business processes  as part  of a drive  to increase  efficiency  and 
flexibility,  i.e., digital  transformation. 
As  a result,  the system  architects,  designers, and programmers  need to integrate  data from  different
sources  and databases  in real-time  or near-real-time.  This is not  easy. 
Avoiding  Database  Conversion 
The Irish  are famous  for their  humorous  reply when  asked  for directions,  ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt  start from  here.‚Äù  Many
database  vendors argue that the solution  to heterogeneous  databases is to  convert  every database  to their 
database  or set  of databases. 
Anybody  with experience  with database  conversions  knows this solution  does not work,  whatever  gimmicks
and  magic  conversion  software are promised.  Wikibon knows first-hand  how wholesale  conversion 
strategies  have caused  banks, insurance  companies,  and many  other enterprise  types irreparable  harm. 
The  cost  of database  conversion  and the disruption  to the  lines  of business  makes a conversion  strategy a
non-starter.  Enterprises should avoid this strategy  like the plague  and remove  any employees  or suppliers 
that  advocate  such an approach.

GoldenGate Augments Cloud Databases 	
Avoiding  Database  Sprawl 
Enterprises  need to take  advantage  of different  data types  and use databases  to manage  these new data
types.  However,  introducing  a new  database  for every  new data  type will lead  to database  sprawl and make 
it  much  more difficult  to achieve  automation  and digital  transformation. 
Wikibon  strongly  recommends  an alternative  strategy of minimizing  the number  of databases  for different
data  types.  Enterprises  can achieve  this by using  converged  databases that support  multiple  data types. 
For  example,  Oracle and SAP  support  almost all data  types,  whereas  each AWS database  and Snowflake‚Äôs
database  support very few data  types. 
Wikibon  recommends  enterprises choose databases  carefully, with the main  criteria  being the ability  to 
support  all data  types  and support  distribution  of databases  across the enterprise  in real-time  or near  real-
time. 
Augmenting  Databases with GoldenGate 
Oracle  acquired  GoldenGate  in 2009.  It is  a comprehensive  software package for real-time  data integration
and  replication.  It also  enables  high availability  solutions, transactional  change data capture, 
transformations,  and verification  between operational  and analytical  enterprise  systems. 
Oracle  GoldenGate  has the following  features: 
Moves  committed  transactions,  which enables  consistency  and improves  performance. 
Moves  data in real-time,  which reduces  end-to-end  latency. 
Supports  a wide  range  of heterogeneous  databases running on a variety  of operating  systems. For 
example,  you can replicate  data from  an Oracle  Database  to a different  heterogeneous  database. 
The  GoldenGate  microservices  architecture is ‚Äúcloud-native.‚Äù 
The  tight  integration  allows high performance  with minimal  overhead  on the  underlying  databases and 
infrastructure. 
Oracle  GoldenGate  enables the exchange  and manipulation  of data  at the  transaction  level among  multiple,
heterogeneous  platforms across an enterprise.  It moves  committed  transactions  with transaction  integrity 
and  low overheads  across existing  infrastructures.  Its modular  architecture  enables users to extract  and
replicate  selected data records,  transactional  changes, and changes  to DDL  (Data  Definition  Language) 
across  various  topologies. 
Oracle  GoldenGate  is used  in many  environments  as a tool  to enable  database  integration.  For example,  it
is  certified  on the  AWS  site to support  AWS Aurora  and other  databases.  There are also  other  tools and 
software  that achieve  similar results. 
Wikibon  believes  that the close  integration  of GoldenGate  with OCI significantly  changes the skill  and time
required  to set  up and  maintain  these environments.  Wikibon believes  this integration  is a gamechanger 
and  expands  its potential  use to enterprises  of any  size. 
GoldenGate  Business Continuity  and High  Availability 
GoldenGate  is an  important  component  of the  Oracle  Maximum  Availability  Architecture  (MAA). To establish 
and  maintain  an MAA  environment,  data must  move  between  multiple servers and data  centers. 
GoldenGate  provides bidirectional  active-active  replication of Oracle  and other  databases  to support  the 
highest  levels of business  continuity.

GoldenGate Augments Cloud Databases 	
Initial  load is extracting  data records  from a source  database  and loading  those records  onto a target 
database.  Initial load is a data  migration  process that is performed  only once.  Oracle  GoldenGate  allows
you  to perform  initial load data  migrations  without taking your systems  offline. 
Data Integration 
Data integration  involves combining  data from  several  disparate  sources stored using various  technologies
and  providing  a unified  view of the  data.  Oracle  GoldenGate  provides real-time  data integration. 
Definitions  of Convergence  & Distribution 
Previous  Wikibon research  established  there are two  main  dimensions  to the  evaluation  of Cloud  Database 
Platforms. 
1.  Convergence  is the  ability  to use  multiple  data and database  types in real-time  or near-real-time  with 
predictable  performance.  Convergence capabilities include enabling  transactional  and analytic 
databases  to work  together,  as the  most  valuable  applications  will combine  both. Enterprises  can use 
GoldenGate  to improve  combining  different database  types. 
2.  Distribution  is the  ability  to: 
Distribute  copies of data  to meet  availability  and consistency  requirements  of databases  in many  local 
domains.  Goldengate  can significantly  assist in managing  this distribution. 
Distribute  domain ownership  of databases  in the  form  of a ‚ÄúData  Mesh‚Äù  while maintaining  metadata 
control  to enable  enterprise  compliance,  provenance,  and data  security.  (See the reference  to Data 
Mesh  in Footnotes  below for more  detail.) 
GoldenGate  & Cloud  Database  Platforms 
GoldenGate  Announcement  as a Database  Service 
Oracle has recently  announced  GoldenGate  as an  OCI  database  service. In recent  research,  Wikibon 
identified  two components  that are vital  for a successful  Cloud Database  Platform. These are Database 
Convergence  and Data  Distribution.  GoldenGate in OCI  will significantly  enhance the Data  Distribution
component  of most  Cloud  Database  Platforms,  including Oracle, AWS RDS,  IBM DB2,  and Microsoft  SQL 
Server.  This capability  dramatically  extends the range  of customers  who will take  advantage  of the
GoldenGate  functionality.  IT does  not need  to invest  resources  to install,  manage,  and maintain  the 
software  on-premises. 
Data Warehouse  & Lake  Problems 
There are many  database  analyst‚Äôs views available  for subsets  of the  database  and database  management. 
Data  warehouses  and data  lakes  are often  stripped  off and  reviewed  as a stand-alone  product. Wikibon and
other  researchers  have shown  that the CIO  and  the lines  of business  think that the investments  in data 
warehouses  and data  lakes  have not yielded  the results  that the vendors  promised.  CIO concerns  include
late  delivery  of data,  data compliance  and provenance,  poor documentation,  and too many  versions  of the 
truth. 
Wikibon  believes  that database  convergence  and database  distribution  capabilities are important  because
they  allow  enterprises  to integrate  data sources,  ensure consistency  between distributed  data, and provide 
automated  tools to ensure  compliance  and provenance.  GoldenGate is an  important  element in achieving
these  goals.

GoldenGate Augments Cloud Databases 	
Technology  Impacts on Database  Architecture 
Wikibon believes  that database  technologies  have evolved  to remove  the hard  break  between  transactional
systems  of record  and data  warehousing.  Data in-memory  technologies,  persistent storage layers, smart 
flash  storage,  and mixed  columnar  and row-based  architectures  have allowed  operational  systems of record
to  use  real-time  analytics when needed,  proven provenance  and compliance,  and a single  version  of the 
truth.  With instant  scaling  of database  cloud services,  these capabilities  are central  to allowing  full 
automation  of complex  business  processes. 
Technology  Impacts on Database  Distribution 
The other  technology  impact is the  cost  of computing.  Traditional linear x86 architectures  doubled in speed
or  number  of cores  every  18 months  to two  years  (Moore‚Äôs  Law). However,  new heterogeneous  parallel 
architectures  from Arm have  improved  processing  speed by 118%  over the last  5 years,  measured  in TOPS
or  Trillions  of Operations  per Second.  The cost  of compute  is coming  down, especially  in Matrix  workloads 
such  as ML  and  AI. The  comparative  cost of compute  operations  is dropping  far faster  than the cost  of
storage  and networking. 
This  means  enterprises  will push  real-time  computing  to where  the data  is created,  mostly at the  Edge. 
Enterprises  will immediately  process most of this  data  at the  Edge,  keeping  only small  amounts  of valuable
resultant  data there.  Again,  enterprises  will push  requests  for analysis  to the  Edge  rather  than move  data 
across  the network  to a traditional  data lake. 
Databases  will need  to manage  distributed  real-time data, manage  compliance  and provenance,  and
manage  a single  version  of the  truth.  GoldenGate  will play  an important  role in this  evolution. 
Challenges  of Traditional  Databases;  How Cloud 
Databases  Help 
Complexity 
Traditional databases need expensive  people specialized  in software  and hardware  to run  large  database
systems.  DBAs, storage  specialists,  system administrators,  and network  specialists  must keep databases 
and  infrastructure  up to date,  optimize  performance,  isolate bottlenecks,  and keep  fragile  systems  running.
Data  workflows  are complex  and tortuous  for transactional,  analytic, and other  single-purpose  database 
systems,  requiring  data managers,  data architects,  data scientists,  data engineers,  statisticians,  storage
specialists,  and many  more specialized  and expensive  people to manage  the data  stored  in many  silos. 
Data  is moved  and transformed  without context.  The resulting  centralized  data lakes  and data  warehouses
are  the  triumph  of hope  over experience. 
1.  The  first  way  Cloud  Database  Platform Providers  can tackle  the problem  of complexity  is by  providing 
autonomous  capabilities. The Cloud  Database  Provider delivers automation  of upgrades,  indexing, 
performance,  recovery, backup, patching,  and more.  Providers  with volume  and who  utilize  machine 
learning  algorithms  based on many  users will drive  continuous  improvements. 
2.  The  second  way Cloud  Databases  can provide  radical simplicity  is to  support  the physical  distribution 
and  management  of data  close  to where  the enterprise  first creates  and uses  it. The  people  responsible 
for  data  creation  are usually  best positioned  to define  what the data  means  in their  domain  and keep 
the  data  in context  with other  data and processes  to support  its business  needs. 
3.  The  third  requirement  for an enterprise  Cloud Database  is to  automate  the collection  and distribution  of 
metadata  between all the  domains  and provide  the services  to optimize  and predict  workloads‚Äô

performance  using data over multiple  locations. 
Wikibon  believes  that autonomous  databases are essential  to reduce  the cost  and complexity  of using  data. 
This  simplicity  and automation  will allow  domain  business  staff to directly  define and consume  their data
and  broadcast  the metadata  to other  domains. 	
Database  and Data  Types 
Database  and data  types  have exploded  in the  last  two  decades,  with many  providers  introducing  different
database  types for each  one. Examples  include Advanced  Analytic, AI Inference,  AI Learning,  Blockchain, 
Document,  Graph, Key-value,  Inference, In-memory,  Log-file, NoSQL, and Time-series  databases. Each of
these  databases  deals with different  data types  and provides  specialized  structures to improve 
performance  and reduce  complexity. 
Some  of these  database  types have robust  independent  implementations,  such as MongoDB  (Document),
SAP  HANA  (In-memory),  and Splunk  (Log-file).  Cloud providers  support them all; for example,  AWS has 
sixteen  different  database  types. However,  the user  workflows  between the different  database  types have
become  extraordinarily  complex and insecure.  Data transformations  and the time  to move  data result  in 
higher  costs, loss of data  context,  and significantly  reduce the data‚Äôs  business  value. 
The  longer  elapsed  times mean  that synchronizing  applications using transaction  and analytic  databases  is
much  more challenging  (and usually  impossible)  to achieve.  Synchronous  applications enable a more 
significant  potential for automating  business processes,  making them more valuable  in creating  data-first
business  processes.  The bottom  line is converged  databases that scale  allow  faster  automation  and 
simplification  of business  processes  and reduce  complex  asynchronous  business processes. 
Oracle,  SAP HANA,  and to some  extent  Couchbase,  have developed  converged  databases with a single
database  engine providing  integrated  support for different  databases  and data  types.  The converged 
database  supports transactional  and analytic  database  types working  together.  Equally important  is the
performance  and automation  of each  database  type within  the converged  database. Converged  databases 
provide  an essential  game-changing  reduction in complexity  with equal  or better  performance  than 
specialized  databases. 
Database  Performance 
Cloud Database  Platforms need to support  synchronous  business processes  in real-time  or near-real-time.
These  database  platforms  are complex  and require  specialized  hardware and platform  services to optimize 
performance.  Wikibon is predicting  that flash  drives  will be the  same  cost as HDDs  by 2026.  Flash and
other  non-volatile  memory technologies  will allow  simple  single-tier  storage solutions  that help  enable 
distributed  database solutions.  Improved protocols such as NVMe  and RoCE  (RDMA  over Converged
Ethernet)  radically reduce protocol  overhead  and improve  latency. NVMe also provides  faster and lower 
costs  for any-to-any  connectivity  of processors  and storage.  Non-volatile  memory technology  also simplifies
recovery  and restart  and provides  lower-cost  shared caches. 
Wikibon  believes  that elastic  scalability  is a crucial  attribute  for successful  Cloud Databases.  These 
databases  must use cloud  services  to scale  resources  instantaneously  for short  periods  while the database
keeps  running  to minimize  elapsed time-to-value. 
Arm  processors  and systems  are now  faster  and cheaper  than x86 processors,  and the rate  of improvement 
is  significantly  faster. The challenge  for Arm  processors  is that  vendors  have designed  almost all database
software  for x86  processors.  However, the manufacture  of Arm  wafers  is over  ten times  larger  than x86 
wafers.  This volume  disparity  means that the learning  curves of both  manufacturing  and design  have
outstripped  x86. The latest  Apple  M1 processors  are performing  faster than the latest  equivalent  Intel Tiger 
Lake  i7 chips.

x86 currently  has an advantage  because vendors will need  time and resources  to migrate  software  to Arm. 
However,  Apple and Microsoft  are converting  their PC platforms  to run  primarily  on Arm  and extend  the
platform  to support  Arm mobile  applications . AWS  has invested  in Arm-based  Graviton and is migrating  its 
platform  to Arm  at a rapid  rate. Wikibon  expects cloud platforms  and Cloud  Database  Platforms to migrate
to  work  with Arm,  mainly  because  Apple and Arm  have  developed  heterogeneous  architectures that can 
accelerate  specific workloads  by a hundred  times compared  with the general-purpose  x86 architectures . 
Wikibon  believes  that Cloud  Database  Platforms will adopt  heterogeneous  Arm technology  early because  of 
databases‚Äô  particular performance  requirements. 
Data Distribution 
Enterprises  are increasingly  distributing the location  of data  creation.  The continued  reduction in the  cost 
of  Micro-Electrical  Mechanical Systems (MEMS) capabilities  is pushing  enormous  amounts of data  creation
to  the  Edge  in warehouses,  retail outlets,  energy distribution,  and more.  Edge devices  must often  be 
autonomous,  such as autonomous  cars, planes,  trains, and other  machines. 
Moving  large amounts  of data  is very  expensive.  It takes  a significant  amount of time,  and (as previously
discussed)  data loses  context  if not  processed  at the  point  of creation.  It follows  that databases  must 
support  on-premises  equipment and processing,  in addition  to the  cloud.  This distributed  data processing‚Äôs
primary  use is almost  always  to support  remote business  operations,  such as plants,  warehouses,  and 
autonomous  vehicles. The secondary  benefit is to  provide  data in context  to other  parts of the  business. 
Cloud  Database  Platforms must therefore  be available  in both  public  and private  clouds.  The business
people  who support  the business  operations  at each  location  must define  their data to support  their 
operations  and simultaneously  provide access and context  to other  sites. 
At  the  same  time, organizations  must ensure  compliance  with legal  requirements  and ensure  all data‚Äôs
provenance  and safety  at the  local  and national  level. Databases  will need  to support  a ‚ÄúData  Mesh‚Äù 
approach  and the metadata  requirements  to achieve  this goal. 
Cloud  Database  Platforms:  Horses on the  Track 
Wikibon  believes  there are two  fundamental  requirements  for a Cloud  Database  Platform: the ability  to
support  converged  databases and support  a devolved  distributed  business environment.  Figure 1 provides 
Wikibon‚Äôs  assessment  of the  current  position  of Cloud  Database  Platform providers.

Figure 1 shows  the Wikibon  assessment  of Distribution  capability on the  y-axis  and Convergence  capability
on  the  x-axis.  The diameter  of the  circle  is the  multiplication  of the  two  scores. 
GoldenGate  support AWS RDS (yellow),  IBM DB2  (light  blue),  Microsoft  SQL Server  (grey),  and Oracle 
Databases  (red). Each of these  Cloud  Database  platforms  is assessed  with and without  GoldenGate,  which
provides  distribution  benefit and a small  convergence  benefit. The arrows  connect  the original  score 
without  GoldenGate  to a higher  score with GoldenGate. 
GoldenGate  does not support  CouchBase  (green) and provides  limited support  for SAP  HANA  (dark blue),
and  Snowflake  Cloud Database  platforms  (black). There is a single  point for these  platforms.  The individual 
scores  on each  Database  Cloud Platform  in Figure  1 are  discussed  in more  detail  in the  following  sections. 
Overall,  the chart  shows  that the Oracle  Cloud Database  platform with GoldenGate  is a clear  leader  on both
dimensions.  However, Wikibon observes  that it is  still  early  in the  evolution  of Cloud  Database  Platforms. 
There  is still  significant  potential for improvement  on the  distribution  dimension, which needs  additional
features  such as distributed  data catalogs  and additional  advanced distribution  capabilities to support  data-
meshing.

back to the  community,  and integrated  them well but separately  into the AWS  PaaS.  On the  Distribution 
axis,  AWS has delivered  Outposts,  allowing at the  moment  limited on-premises  RDS implementations,
which  is currently  a small  subset  of the  16 databases.  AWS also has good  support  for data  protection  across 
different  regions in different  countries. 
AWS  has implemented  some enhanced  data movement  between different databases  but has  no announced
strategy  to invest  in converged  database integration.  As a result,  enterprises  that need  to combine  data 
from  different  databases  must perform  time-consuming  and costly  ETL. This architecture  makes combining
data  from  different  data types  (e.g., transactional  and analytic  data) challenging  and time-consuming. 
Apart  from an interesting  blog on Data  Mesh, AWS  has not announced  any data  mesh  capabilities. 
GoldenGate  provides good support  for AWS  RDS and is available  as a tool  on the  AWS  platform.  However,  it
is  supported  as an  as-is  tool and is not  available  as a fully  managed  cloud service. 
The  availability  of GoldenGate  as a service  on OCI  is a significant  improvement  and provides  users of AWS 
RDS  with  consistent  active-active  options in real-time  analytics on OCI.  The GoldenGate  score signifies  this
type  of integration,  not an as-is  implementation. 
Couchbase 
Couchbase  focuses explicitly  on providing  support for transactional  and analytic  databases.  It claims  a
NoSQL  heritage  but has  implemented  a SQL-compliant  combination of analytical  and transactional 
databases. 
Couchbase  has limited  cloud database  distribution  or data  mesh  capabilities.  GoldenGate does not support
Couchbase. 
IBM 
IBM  offers  a Tier-1  (See Footnotes  for a definition  of Tier-1)  DB2 Cloud  Database,  which provides  integrated
transactional  and analytic  capabilities.  IBM provides  good support  for data  protection  but little  logical 
distribution  support. 
GoldenGate  gives excellent  support for DB2,  which  is found  in many  mainframe  systems and financial
organizations.  DB2 databases  are often  complex,  and avoiding  conversion  and integration  will be a sound 
strategy  for many  large financial  organizations. 
IBM  is working  on a separate  distributed  architecture  platform. 
It  is  unclear  if IBM  will integrate  the two  approaches;  Wikibon hopes they will, together  with Red Hat,
provide  a Tier-1  Cloud Database  Platform. Wikibon also hopes  that they  will improve  the open-source  legal 
foundation  to encourage  contributions  from AWS and others. 
Google 
Google  offers BigTable  and Spanner  databases  for OLTP,  and BigQuery  is a data  warehouse  database. 
There  is little  converged  capability between the OLTP  and data  warehouse  databases.  BigQuery is at  heart
a  columnar  database written to take  advantage  of cloud  scalability.  BigQuery is serverless,  has hybrid 
NoSQL  capabilities  such as record  type, and can hold  and address  raw JSON  documents.  BigQuery is a
lightly  converged  analytic database  that excels  when database  sizes are massive. 
Google  offers Google  Anthos for on-premises  Cloud Database  Platform requirements.  Google Anthos 
typically  runs on Cisco  servers  that are not used  by GCP,  meaning  a lack  of architectural  equivalency from
cloud  to on-premises. 
GoldenGate  certifies GCP BigQuery  and GCP  Object  Storage  as delivery  targets.

Microsoft 
Microsoft has a Tier-1  SQL Server  Database  for on-premises  deployment.  Currently, it offers  Azure SQL
Cloud  Database  for transactional  cloud services  and Azure  Synapse  as a data  warehouse  Cloud Database. 
Wikibon  assesses  that users  will find  little  converged  capability between the SQL  Cloud  and Synapse 
Database  offerings. However, GoldenGate  certifies SQL Server  and Azure  Synapse  (delivery  target only) for
Microsoft  SQL Server,  and enterprises  can use it to  improve  integration  between transactional  and analytic 
workloads. 
Microsoft  is developing  Azure Cosmos  DB as a globally  distributed,  scalable, multi-model  database cloud
service  extension  to Azure  Synapse.  It is  building  this service  from the ground  up. Cosmos  DB provides 
native  support  for NoSQL  and OSS  APIs,  including  MongoDB,  Cassandra,  Gremlin, etcd, Spark,  and SQL.  It
offers  multiple  consistency  models from strong  to eventual  and says  it supports  low read  and write 
latencies.  Wikibon understands  that the emphasis  of Cosmos  DB is to  integrate  analytic requirements.  The
Microsoft  Azure SQL services  separately  support transactional  needs. 
Microsoft  offers Azure Stack for on-premises  Cloud Database  requirements.  As noted  in prior  Wikibon 
research,  Azure Stack requires  an Azure  Stack operator  on-site. Microsoft  offers a selection  of qualified 
systems  from five different  vendors.  Wikibon does not rate  this approach  as satisfactory,  lacking 
equivalency  as the  Azure  public  cloud does not deploy  any of these  hardware  systems. 
Microsoft  has the software  and architectural  capabilities to become  a leader  in providing  a Cloud  Database
Platform  and building  its strong  SQL Server  customer  base. It is  giving  mixed  signals  on intent.  GoldenGate 
certifies  both SQL Server  and Azure  Synapse  (Synapse  is delivery  target only). 
Oracle 
Wikibon  believes  Oracle has the leading  converged  database implementation  of all  other  providers  in 
Figure  1. In its  latest  Oracle  Database  21c announcement,  Oracle has improved  many aspects  of its  Tier-1
converged  Cloud Database  Platform, including  performance  improvements  for in-memory,  graph, and 
multi-tenant  processing. In addition,  JavaScript  is in-database.  AutoML for in-database  machine learning
(ML)  is an  additional  automation  capability. Blockchain  Tables provide  immutable  insert-only tables in 
Oracle  Database.  A native  JSON binary  data type was introduced,  which increases  Document  Database
performance  and function.  Oracle has a clear  ongoing  strategy  of reducing  complexity  for DBAs  and data 
users  through  automation,  performance,  and integration  of all  database  and data  types  and is executing
this  strategy  well. 
On  the  distribution  side, Oracle  has excellent  cluster and distributed  processing with RAC (Real  Application 
Clusters),  Active Data Guard  (active-passive  copy distribution),  and Sharding  (shared-nothing  geo-
distribution  of horizontally  partitioned data). Oracle  also announced  its distributed  sharding performance 
and  flexibility  enhancements  in Database  21c. 
Oracle Database  with GoldenGate 
Oracle  acquired  GoldenGate  Oracle in 2009  and is an  integral  part of Oracle  Maximum  Availability 
Architecture  (MAA). Wikibon  has always  admired  Oracle GoldenGate‚Äôs  unique ability to deploy  fault-tolerant
database  replication  combined with real-time  operational  analytic insights,  supporting  Oracle and non-
Oracle  data sources.  GoldenGate  is installed  in the  majority  of Fortune  2000 enterprises  as part  of MAA
implementations. 
The  downside  of GoldenGate  is the  complexity  and cost  of providing  and maintaining  these capabilities. 
However,  the latest  GoldenGate  release on OCI  is a managed  service, which solves  the complexity  and cost
problems  and extends  these capabilities  to every  company  size.

dimension  slightly and significantly  improves the Distribution  dimension. 
SAP HANA  Cloud 
SAP HANA  is an  in-memory  SaaS service  where the updates  and management  of SAP  are managed  by SAP.
The  fundamental  structure of SAP  HANA  is a data  in-memory  columnar SQL database  that supports  a broad 
range  of data  and database  types, including  Analytics,  JSON documents,  Graph, Spatial,  Time-series,
Machine  Learning,  and Blockchain.  Its main  advantage  is to  shorten  the time  required  to create  SAP 
analytic  reports. SAP has an excellent  track record  in achieving  this benefit. 
The  SAP  HANA  architecture  also has a Row-based  view of the  data,  enabling  SAP to provide  transaction
processing  of SAP  systems  of record.  As discussed  in the  introduction,  this capability  is important  to 
enterprises  because it allows  applications  to have  consistent  and coherent  access to real-time  analytic data
and  provide  a single  source  of truth,  eliminating  the risk  of inconsistent  data across  the organization  and 
improving  the ability  to automate  complex business  processes  fully. 
However,  SAP does  not currently  provide the high  availability,  recovery, and transaction  performance
expected  for Tier-1  systems-of-record  in HANA  Cloud  S4. SAP  has said  that HANA  will support  all 
environments,  including HA transaction  services, by December  2025. On December  31, 2027,  SAP plans  to
withdraw  support for SAP  ‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù  products running on other  databases.  This date  is the  latest  of many 
that  SAP has published.  Given customers‚Äô  reluctance to move,  Wikibon  believes  this date  will move  out
again. 
Wikibon  would point out there  are only  three  Tier-1  Databases  at the  moment.  They are IBM  DB2,  Microsoft 
SQL  Server,  and Oracle  Database.  It took  the vendors  decades  to provide  and prove  the advanced  high-
availability  and recovery  features.  The software  market usually has a long  tail, and ERP  is no  exception. 
SAP  is a leading  vendor in ERP,  with about  6% of the  total  ERP market.  Wikibon‚Äôs  research indicates
that  most  of SAP‚Äôs  largest  customers  run on Oracle  Database.  Wikibon believes  SAP does  not have  the 
volume  of SAP  HANA  database  instances  to develop  full Tier-1  capabilities  and will not increase  volumes by
selling  SAP HANA  as a general-purpose,  stand-alone database. 
Wikibon  believes  the current  cloud databases  from Google,  IBM, Microsoft  Azure, Oracle  (and AWS, 
assuming  it invests  in developing  a fully  converged  database) will radically  improve multi-cloud  and cloud-
on-premises  converged database solutions.  Wikibon believes  it is  very  likely  and SAP  customers  will 
demand  to continue  to run  the Tier-1  database  of their  choice  for SAP  and other  software. 
Apart  from an interesting  blog on SAP  HANA  data mesh  capabilities , SAP  has limited  capabilities  for
implementing  a distributed  data mesh.  Some enterprises  use GoldenGate  with SAP HANA  with integration 
supported  via existing  certified  APIs such  as JDBC,  Kafka,  and Object  Storage . 
Snowflake 
Snowflake  has created  significant  momentum,  focusing on reducing  complexity  with improved  ease-of-use 
and  time-to-value  for data  warehouses.  Snowflake has also  introduced  enhanced capabilities  for sharing
data  warehouses,  with some  Data Mesh  capabilities.  However, Snowflake  has an isolated  cloud-only 
analytic  SQL database  with limited  advanced  functions and is still  in the  gate  regarding  convergence.
Snowflake  currently has an immature  ability to integrate  machine learning. 
Some  enterprises  use GoldenGate  with Snowflake  with integration  supported via existing  certified  APIs such 
as  JDBC,  Kafka,  and Object  Storage .

GoldenGate Augments Cloud Databases 	
An early  study  of the  automobile  market concluded  that the number  of chauffeurs  available would constrain 
the  market‚Äôs  size. Ford showed  that making  cars simple  and in volume  made chauffeurs  redundant.
Similarly,  the demand  for household  telephones  was thought  to be  constrained  by the  number  of telephone 
operators  before AT&T automated  phone calls. 
In  the  same  way, Wikibon  believes  that Cloud  Database  Platforms will remove  the dependence  on 
expensive  IT staff  by automating  many mundane  tasks and devolving  data management  and exploitation  to 
the  lines  of business. 
Figure  1 shows  the horses  on the  Cloud  Database  Platform track. Wikibon‚Äôs  overall assessment  is that  three
furlongs  in, Oracle  is lengths  ahead on the  Convergence  dimension. Oracle with GoldenGate  has moved 
ahead  of Snowflake  on the  Distribution  dimension. 
Both  of these  dimensions  are critical  to providing  a Cloud  Database  Platform with the automation,  ease of
use,  robustness,  and flexibility  to support  data-led  enterprises  without crippling  IT staff  overheads.  Figure 1 
also  shows  that across  providers,  convergence  is further  ahead than distribution.  There is still  room  for
innovation  in Cloud  Database  Platforms,  and companies  like Snowflake  have shown  the importance  of ease-
of-use  and devolution  to the  lines  of business. 
Wikibon  believes  that large  enterprises  understand  that the choice  of Cloud  Database  Platform is a more
critical  and strategic  decision than the choice  between  alternative  Cloud IaaS or PaaS  platforms  in the  data-
led  journey. 
Vendor  Future Assessments 
Databases  are complex  technologies  where, in addition  to convergence  and distribution,  automation, 
performance,  and reliability  are critical. 
Wikibon  assesses  that AWS  is doing  well within  its limitations.  It currently  supports mainly smaller
organizations  with smaller-scale  database requirements.  As Wikibon  noted in prior  research,  the more 
databases  and data  types  exist, the more  specialized  transfer systems  are required.  Sixteen databases
would  require  120 different  transformation  transport systems. Fifty database  types would  require  1,225. 
AWS  will undoubtedly  provide a stable  and highly  performant  IaaS and PaaS  platform  for itself  and other 
providers.  AWS is ahead  of other  vendors  moving to Arm  technology,  reducing costs and increasing
performance.  However, AWS still has to invest  in converged  and distributed  database software with built-in 
tier-1  and HA recovery  systems to be  a long-term  enterprise  player in cloud  databases. 
Suppose  AWS wants  to move  upmarket  and meet  the requirements  of enterprise-level,  mission-critical
databases  and provide  for the  aggressive  scope of future  automation  applications.  In that  case,  Wikibon 
believes  AWS must  radically  change its strategy.  Instead of leaving  developers  to integrate  the databases
with  its platform‚Äôs  high-availability  capabilities, AWS must  provide  an integrated  and fully  supported  Tier-1 
level  high-availability  and recovery  capability.  To develop  an integrated  Cloud Database  Platform, AWS will
need  to invest  significant  resources to change  from adding  extensions  to open-source  databases to 
developing  in-house AWS software  for an integrated  Cloud Database  Platform. AWS will need  to develop
both  convergence  and distribution  capabilities in such  a platform.  Also, AWS will need  to bring  more  of its 
databases  to Outposts  to meet  the distribution  capabilities fully. And AWS  will need  to allow  its databases
to  run  on other  clouds  such as Alibaba,  Google, Microsoft  Azure, Oracle  OCI, and Tencent. 
Google  has developed  its databases  primarily for its own  use in their  particular  and unique  business  but 
has  struggled  to make  its Cloud  Database  Platform offerings  relevant to enterprises.  Wikibon believes  that
Google  will probably  partner with other  database  vendors. 
IBM  has significant  experience  in Tier-1  databases,  has strong  enterprise  service and sales  capabilities, 
and  has developed  impressive  potential Data Mesh  capabilities.  Although IBM is nascent  in cloud  services,
IBM  and  Red  Hat have  the financial,  technical,  and research  capabilities  to invest  in developing  a Cloud

Database  Platform. Wikibon believes  IBM and  Red  Hat should  and probably  will invest  in developing  a full-
fledged  Cloud Database  Platform with both  convergence  and distributed  data mesh  capabilities. 
Microsoft  has significant  experience  in developing  a Tier-1  database  and has strong  enterprise  marketing
and  software  distribution  capabilities.  It has  built  a strong  SaaS presence  around its Office  and Teams 
software.  Also, Microsoft  is a primary  IaaS/PaaS  cloud infrastructure  provider and is supporting  a multi-
cloud  strategy. 
Wikibon  is impressed  with the vision  for Microsoft  Cosmos DB. Wikibon  believes  that Microsoft  will need  to 
integrate  its Tier-1  transactional  SQL Server  with Cosmos  DB in the  future.  Microsoft  has robust  distributed
services  on the  distribution  axis, and Cosmos  DB allows  data to be  placed  close to the  users.  However, 
Microsoft  will need  to enhance  its Azure  Stack offering  based on third-party  hardware, which Wikibon
assesses  as inadequate,  lacking architectural  equivalency. Overall, Wikibon  believes  Microsoft  has the 
financial  resources  and technical  capabilities  to develop  a Cloud  Database  Platform and upper  management
flexibility  to partner  with others.  Wikibon  expects Microsoft  to invest  heavily  in developing  a Cloud 
Database  Platform and maintain  its lead  over  AWS  and Google. 
Figure  1 shows  Oracle  has by far  the  best  Tier-1  Cloud Database  Platform and has developed  a robust
infrastructure  platform with Oracle  Exadata  X8M that is the  basis  of database  services on Oracle  Cloud 
Infrastructure  and Exadata  Cloud@Customer,  delivering architectural  equivalency. Oracle Cloud@Customer
Cloud  Database  Platform is moving  powerfully  down the database  convergence  dimensions. In addition,  the 
Oracle  strategy  of making  all the  cloud  database  services autonomous  is shown  by the  Oracle  Database
21c  announcements  in early  2021.  Oracle  Database  21c is initially  available  on OCI  via the  Autonomous 
Database  service (in the  Always  Free Tier)  and Oracle  Exadata  Cloud Service.  Oracle Autonomous  Database
is  Oracle‚Äôs  self-managing,  self-tuning, and self-securing  cloud service  built on Oracle‚Äôs  converged  database 
engine. 
Oracle  has already  developed  a multi-cloud  agreement with Microsoft.  Wikibon expects AWS and Oracle  to
reach  an agreement  to ensure  that Oracle  runs well on AWS  and can link to Oracle  Database  hardware. 
The  announcement  of OCI  support  for GoldenGate  has significantly  improved the distribution  dimension for 
the  Oracle  Cloud Database  platform. Oracle will need  to include  data catalogs  to help  integrate  different
databases.  Oracle will also  need  to expand  its sharding  feature further and invest  strongly  in a Data 
Mesh  architecture  and functionality  to allow  enterprises  to devolve  and simplify  data-led  strategies  to
include  the lines  of business.  In other  interesting  work, Oracle  uses AI and  ML to enrich  metadata  in an 
Oracle  Cloud Infrastructure  Data Catalog. 
This  decentralization  strategy may bring  them  into potential  conflict with centralized  IT development
executives  who value  and evaluate  Oracle‚Äôs Database  products. However,  Wikibon believes  the Cloud 
Database  Platform is ripe  for disruption  driven by simple-to-use  database and data  management  software
that  will empower  less technical  users in the  lines  of business. 
Wikibon  believes  that Oracle  has the vision  and management  drive to extend  its lead  in the  Cloud  Database 
Platform  market. 
The  SAP  HANA  Cloud Platform  is difficult  to evaluate.  SAP started  developing  SAP HANA  when the cloud
was  still nascent,  and other  databases  did not  provide  the integration  between transactional  and analytics. 
For  a time,  SAP HANA  was the leading  platform  for ensuring  that analytic  data could  be distributed  rapidly
to  the  end-users  in the  lines  of business.  However,  Wikibon believes  that the predicted  investments  by AWS 
and  Microsoft,  and the investments  already made by Oracle,  reduce any SAP  HANA  differentiation.  The
most  valuable  SAP contribution  is its  software  suites, and Wikibon  believes  SAP customers  would prefer 
greater  flexibility  on which  cloud and database  platform to deploy  the SAP  software. 
SAP  is not  offering  SAP HANA  as a general-purpose  database, and therefore  the potential  number of SAP
HANA  database  instances  is limited.  In software,  volume wins. Wikibon  believes  that SAP will probably

change  its current  Cloud Database  Platform strategy. 
Snowflake  has made  good initial  progress  on ease-of-use  and devolved  data warehouses.  Snowflake needs 
to  expand  its TAM  to justify  its market  cap and  has experienced  technical architects.  Wikibon expects that
Snowflake  will invest  in convergence  with a combination  of acquisition  and integration.  Wikibon 
understands  that the Snowflake  Data Mesh  implementation  is currently  envisioned  as an  ability  to connect
with  any other  domain,  internal and external,  and move  any required  data. Wikibon  believes  that Snowflake 
will  need  to develop  a distributed  database capability,  including on-premises  deployment,  to allow  data to
remain  in place.  Also, Snowflake  lacks in-database  machine-learning  algorithms. Although all these 
requirements  are technically  challenging,  Wikibon considers  that Snowflake  must take up the  challenge  or
risk  being  sidelined  by Microsoft  and Oracle. 
Assessment  Summary 
Wikibon believes  that Oracle  has the strongest  Cloud Database  Platform with Autonomous  Database and
can  be integrated  with the GoldenGate  OCI service.  It offers  a Tier-1  database  foundation,  Oracle Exadata 
Cloud@Customer,  which provides  identical Exadata X8M hardware  and software  in on-premises  private
clouds  managed  centrally.  Oracle also provides  Dedicated  Region Cloud@Customer,  a complete  portfolio of 
public  cloud services  and Oracle  Fusion SaaS applications  into an on-premises  data center.  Wikibon
believes  that the integration  of different  databases  with the OCI  GoldenGate  service is a gamechanger. 
Oracle  should  shift its marketing  to emphasize  its ability  to provide  the best  hardware,  interconnectivity,
and  integration  for all databases. 
Wikibon  believes  that Snowflake  has impressive  ease-of-use  for end-users  and a potentially  impressive 
Data  Mesh  vision.  Snowflake  will need  to execute  well and quickly  on its overall  vision. 
Wikibon  is impressed  with the vision  for Microsoft  Cosmos DB. Microsoft  also has a Tier-1  database 
foundation  in SQL  Server.  Wikibon  believes  that Microsoft  will need  to integrate  its Tier-1  transactional  SQL 
Server  with Cosmos  DB in the  future.  Microsoft  can use the GoldenGate  OCI service  to improve  the 
integration  of multiple  heterogeneous  databases. 
Action Item 
Wikibon  strongly  recommends  that senior  enterprise  executives  focus intently  on developing  Cloud
Database  Platforms,  which are fully  converged  and excel  across  both transactional  and analytic  data types. 
The  converged  database must also support  Data Mesh  features  and allow  distributions  of data  where  the
data  is created  and the ability  of lines  of business  to work  directly  and own  the data  that is vital  to them. 
They  will radically  improve the cost,  time-to-value,  and functionality  when used to implement  data-driven
strategies. 
At  the  moment,  Oracle Database  is a Tier-1,  mission-critical  converged Cloud Database  Platform, which is 
lengths  ahead in the  convergence  dimension. The ability  to use  GoldenGate  as an  OCI  service  pulls Oracle
ahead  of Snowflake  on the  distribution  dimension. 
Microsoft  is a dominant  software developer  and has a strong  Tier-1 SQL Server  Cloud Database  platform. Its 
development  of Cosmos  DB is early  but is architecturally  sound. Microsoft  needs to expand  its convergence
and  distribution  capabilities and take  advantage  of GoldenGate  services. 
Wikibon  recommends  that senior  executives  at large  enterprises,  especially those with significant  Oracle 
installations,  start investing  in Oracle  Autonomous  Database on OCI  or on-premises  with Cloud@Customer
while  continuing  to track  the development  of other  Cloud  Database  Platforms.  Wikibon also recommends 
that  senior  executives  invest in GoldenGate  as a service  to integrate  different databases  and avoid
database  conversions.  Wikibon believes  this can radically  improve the cost,  functionality,  and time-to-value 
required  to implement  data-led strategies.

Footnotes 
Data Mesh  Reference 
Zhanak  Dehghani  of ThoughtWorks  is an  authority  on the  simplification  and devolution  of Enterprise  Data 
Management.  This discussion  between Dave Vellante  and Zhanak  Dehghani  is an  excellent  introduction  to 
the  subject. 
Cloud  Database  Platform Definition 
Cloud Databases  are an emerging  category of databases.  A Cloud  Database  Platform is a service  delivered 
from  an integrated  cloud platform.  A Cloud  Database  Platform enables enterprises  to utilize  Cloud Database 
services  on demand  without an initial  investment  cost for equipment  and licenses.  It also  allows  enterprises 
to  manage  distributed  databases remotely on private  clouds or shared  clouds. 
A  Cloud  Database  Platform can reside  in a private  cloud, public cloud,  hybrid  cloud, and multi-cloud 
environments.  From an application  perspective,  the database  services are identical.  The only  difference  lies 
in  where  the database  resides. 
Tier-1 Database  Definition 
Tier-1 Databases  have a strong  track record  of performance  and reliability  for large-scale  mission-critical 
applications.  Such a track  record  takes many  years to achieve.  At the  moment  (2021), Wikibon  considers 
only  three  vendors  offer Tier-1  databases.  The three  are IBM  DB2,  Microsoft  SQL Server,  and Oracle 
Database.

The path 


27/46
The Sink
Sink methods are the dangerous methods that we want to reach. We can define them in CodeQL like this :
RuntimeExec the CodeQL class name
extends the Methodclass
defined in the java.langpackage
in the Runtime class
method name is exec
private
class RuntimeExec extends Method {
RuntimeExec (){
hasQualifiedName ( ‚Äù java . lang ‚Äù , ‚Äù Runtime ‚Äù , ‚Äù exec ‚Äù )
}
} 


28/46
The Sink
from
MethodAccess ma
where
ma
.
getMethod () instanceof RuntimeExec
select
ma
sink 


29/46
The Sink
class
DangerousMethod extends Callable {
DangerousMethod (){
this
instanceof ExpressionEvaluationMethod or
this
instanceof ReflectionInvocationMethod or
this
instanceof RuntimeExec or
this

this

this

this

this
instanceof ClassLoader or
this
instanceof ContextLookup or
this
instanceof OGNLEvaluation or
this
instanceof DriverManagerMethods or
this
instanceof System
}
} 


30/46
The Sink
We want all the methods that calls a
DangerousMethod, so we look forMethodAccessof dangerous methods, and we
use the enclosing callable as a result :
private
class CallsDangerousMethod extends Callable {
CallsDangerousMethod (){
exists
( MethodAccess ma | ma . getMethod () instanceof DangerousMethod and ma .
getEnclosingCallable () = this )
}
} 


31/46
The Sink
from
Callable c
where
c
instanceof CallsDangerousMethod
select
c
sink 


32/46
The Source
A source is a method that we can call to start the gadget chain, the first obvious one is
readObject but there are other
methods like :
readObjectNoData
readResolve
readExternal
‚Ä¶ 


33/46
The Source
There are other methods that have been used in other known chains that we can add :
hashCode
equals
compare

The NoSQL RDBMS 	
One of first uses of the phrase  NoSQL is due to Carlo  Strozzi, circa 1998.  
 
NoSQL:  
ÔÅÆ A fast, portable, open -source RDBMS 
ÔÅÆ A derivative of the RDB database system (Walter Hobbs, RAND)  
ÔÅÆ Not a full -function DBMS, per se, but a shell -level tool  
ÔÅÆ User interface ‚Äì  Unix shell  
ÔÅÆ Based on the ‚Äúoperator/stream paradigm‚Äù  
 
 
 
 	
  

NoSQL Today 	
More recently:  
ÔÇß	The term has taken on different meanings  	
ÔÇß	One common interpretation is ‚Äúnot only SQL‚Äù  
 	
Most  modern  NoSQL systems diverge from the relational model or standard RDBMS functionality:  
 
The data model: relations    documents 
  tuples  vs.  graphs 
  attributes    key/values 
  domains 
  normalization 
 
The query model:  relational algebra   graph traversal 
  tuple calculus vs.  text search 
    map/reduce 
 
The implementation:  rigid schemas   vs.  flexible schemas  
    (schema -less)  
  ACID compliance  vs.  BASE 
 
In that sense, NoSQL today is more commonly meant to be something like ‚Äúnon- relational‚Äù

ACID vs. BASE	 	
Database systems traditionally support ACID requirements: 
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability 
 
In a distributed  web applications the focus shifts to:  	
Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance  
 
CAP theorem  - At most two of the above can be enforced at any given time.  
 	
Reducing  consistency, at least  temporarily, maintains the other two . 
 
Thus, distributed NoSQL systems are typically said to support some form of BASE:  
Basic Availability  
Soft state  
Eventual consistency*

The rise of Big data NosQL Platforms
NosQL is more than a decade old. it has gone from supporting simple schemaless apps to becoming a 
mission-critical data platform for large fortune 1000 companies. it has already disrupted the database 
market, which was dominated for decades by relational database vendors. Today, half of global data and 
analytics technology decision makers either have implemented or are implementing NosQL platforms, 
taking advantage of the benefits of a flexible database that serves \a broad range of use cases.	
1 
enterprises like NosQLís ability to scale out using low-cost servers and a exible, schemale\ss model that 
can store, process, and access any type of business data. NosQL platforms give ea pros greater control 
over data storage and processing, along with a configuration that accelerates application depl\oyments. 
While many organizations are complementing their relational databases with NosQL, some have started 
to replace them to support improved performance, scale, and lower their database costs.
forrester defines big data NosQL as:
A nonrelational database management system that provides storage, processing, \and accessing 
of any type of data and which supports a horizontal, scale-out architect\ure based on a 
schemaless and flexible data model.
NoSQL Vendors continue To Deliver enterprise Features To Support complex Workloads
NosQL covers a range of nonrelational databases, such as key-value, document, and graph 
databases, that are optimized for a new generation of business apps, including social medi\a, customer 
360, advanced insights, real-time, and operational apps. NosQL vendors are delivering innovative 
features, such as ai and machine learning automation, integration with apache spark and streaming 
technology, support for sQL and simplified aPis, and extensive administrative tools. enterprises 
seeking NosQL platforms should look for vendors that:  
‚Ä∫ Focus on AI/machine learning automation deployment capabilities. With organizations ramping 
up their NosQL database deployments, the need for greater automation has become critical. 
This includes automating provisioning, tuning, optimization, indexing, patching, upgrading, high 
availability, and security. These capabilities not only accelerate deployments; they also support \
larger and more complex applications with minimal effort. enterprise buyers should take heed of 
the various differences in ai/machine learning automation offerings and carefully map them to their 
specific requirements, now and for the future.
 
‚Ä∫ Press the advantages of open source. digital transformation often runs on open source 
software.	
2 Today, open source NosQL solutions are stable and ready for primetime. enterprises like 
NosQLís rapidly evolving ecosystem, low cost, minimized vendor lock-in, and ea\sier customization 
for complex deployments. While many NosQL vendors offer open source solutions, look for 
vendors that lead active NosQL communities, contribute software to enhance the open source 
platform, and engage with customers to drive innovation. Pricing, packag\ing, and support services 
also differentiate the vendors.

‚Ä∫ Integrate with large ecosystems for tools and technologies. NosQL databases are the 
foundation on which to build great, modern business applications and support advanced insights. 
However, NosQL needs a strong ecosystem of tools and technologies offered by partners that can 
help accelerate deployments. These include tools to support data integra\tion, data quality, security, 
governance, distributed management, and data pipelining. When acquiring a NosQL platform, ea 
pros should look at the breadth and depth of partnerships the vendor supports to take advantage 
of their tools and services.

in our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors to consider for the evaluation. 
from that initial pool of vendors, we narrow our final list based on the inclusion criteria. We then gather 
details of product and strategy through a detailed questionnaire, demos/briefings, and customer 
reference surveys/interviews. We use those inputs, along with the analyst‚Äôs experience and expertise in 
the marketplace, to score vendors, using a relative rating system that compares each vendor against 
the others in the evaluation.
We include the forrester Wave publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of each forrester 
Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in this forrester Wave using materials they 
provided to us by december 19, 2019, and did not allow additional information after that po\int. We 
encourage readers to evaluate how the market and vendor offerings change over time.
in accordance with The forrester Wave‚Ñ¢ vendor review Policy, forrester asks vendors to review our 
findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. v endors marked as nonparticipating vendors in the 
forrester Wave graphic met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to partici\pate in or contributed 
only partially to the evaluation. We score these vendors in accordance with The forrester Wave‚Ñ¢ and 
The forrester New Wave‚Ñ¢ Nonparticipating and incomplete Participation v endor Policy and publish 
their positioning along with those of the participating vendors.
Integrity Policy
We conduct all our research, including forrester Wave evaluations, in accordance with the integrity 
Policy posted on our website.

Introduction	to	SL1	PowerFlow	and	the	
PowerFlow	Builder	
O v e r v i e w
SL1	PowerFlow	provides	ageneric	platform	for	integrations	between	SL1	and	third-	party	platforms.	From	the	
PowerFlow	user	interface,	you	can	use	the	PowerFlow	Builder	to	create	complicated	automations	with	logical	
branching	using	drag-	and-	drop	components.	
NOTE:	After	the	2.1.0	platform	release,	the	Integration	Service	was	rebranded	as	SL1	¬†PowerFlow	,which	is	
available	in	SL1	Standard	solutions.	Also,	the	Automation	Builder	was	rebranded	as	SL1	¬†PowerFlow	
builder	,which	is	available	in	SL1	Premium	solutions.	For	more	information,	see	ScienceLogic	
Pricing	.	
This	chapter	covers	the	following	topics:	
What	is	SL1	PowerFlow?	10	
What	is	the	SL1	PowerFlow	Builder?	11	
What	is	a	Step?	12

SL1	PowerFlow	enables	intelligent,	bi-	directional	communication	between	the	ScienceLogic	data	platform	and	
external	data	platforms	to	promote	aunified	management	ecosystem.	PowerFlow	allows	users	to	translate	and	
share	data	between	SL1	and	other	platforms	without	the	need	for	programming	knowledge.	PowerFlow	is	
designed	to	provide	high	availability	and	scalability.	
The	following	image	shows	an	example	of	aPowerFlow	application	and	its	steps	in	the	PowerFlow	user	interface:	
The	key	elements	of	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	include	the	following:	
l	Steps	.A	step	is	ageneric	Python	class	that	performs	asingle	action.	Steps	can	accept	zero	or	many	input	
parameters	or	data	from	previous	steps,	and	steps	can	specify	output	to	be	used	by	other	steps.	The	input	
parameters	are	configurable	variables	and	values	used	during	execution.	Steps	can	be	re-	used	in	multiple	
PowerFlow	applications.	When	these	steps	are	combined	in	an	application,	they	provide	aworkflow	that	
satisfies	abusiness	requirement.	All	Python	step	code	should	be	Python	3.7	or	later.	In	the	image	above,	the	
steps	display	as	part	of	the	flowchart	in	the	main	viewing	pane	as	well	as	the	Steps¬†Registry	pane.	
l	Applications	.An	application	is	aJSON¬†object	that	includes	all	the	information	required	for	executing	an	
integration	on	the	PowerFlow	platform.	An	application	combines	aset	of	steps	that	execute	aworkflow.	The	
input	parameters	for	each	step	are	also	defined	in	the	application	and	can	be	provided	either	directly	in	the	
step	or	in	the	parent	application.	In	the	image	above,	the	group	of	connected	steps	in	the	large	pane	make	
up	the	""Sync¬†Organizations	from	SL1	to	ServiceNow	Companies""	application.	You	can	access	all	
applications	on	the	Applications	page	(	),	and	you	can	create	new	applications	using	the	SL1	PowerFlow	
builder	.	
What	is	SL1	PowerFlow? 

What	is	the	SL1	PowerFlow	Builder?	
l	Configuration	Objects	.A	configuration	object	is	astand-	alone	JSON	file	that	contains	aset	of	configuration	
variables	used	as	input	for	an	application.	Configurations	can	include	variables	like	hostname,	user	name,	
password,	or	other	credential	information.	Configuration	objects	allow	the	same	application	to	be	deployed	
in	multiple	PowerFlow	instances,	with	different	configurations.	Click	the	[Configure	]button	from	an	
application	in	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	to	access	the	configuration	object	for	that	application.	You	can	
access	all	configuration	objects	on	the	Configurations	page	(	).	
l	Synchronization	PowerPacks	.A	Synchronization	PowerPack	(also	called	aSyncPack)	contains	all	the	code	
and	logic	needed	to	perform	integrations	on	the	PowerFlow	platform.	You	can	access	the	latest	steps,	
applications,	and	configurations	for	PowerFlow	or	athird-	party	integration	(such	as	ServiceNow,	Cherwell,	or	
Restorepoint)	by	downloading	the	most	recent	Synchronization	PowerPack	for	that	integration	from	
ScienceLogic.	You	can	access	all	Synchronization	PowerPacks	on	the	SyncPacks	page	(	).	
W h a t	i s	th e	S L 1	P o w e r F l o w	B u i l d e r	?	
You	can	use	the	SL1	PowerFlow	builder	in	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	to	create	complicated	applications	with	
logical	branching	and	data	transformation	features	using	drag-	and-	drop	components.	You	access	the	PowerFlow	
builder	on	the	Applications	page	in	the	PowerFlow	user	interface.	
For	example,	from	the	Steps	Registry	pane¬†on	an	Application	page,	you	can	drag	aCondition	operator	(	)	
onto	an	application	workflow	to	create	the	option	for	branching	flows,	such	as	If-	Else	or	If-	Then-	Else	statements:	
11 

12
Also,	you	can	drag	aTransform	operator	(	)from	the	Steps	Registry	pane	onto	an	application	workflow	to	pull	
data	gathered	by	aprevious	step	and	modify	or	transform	the	data	to	fit	into	the	next	step:	
For	more	information	about	the	PowerFlow	builder	,see	Managing	PowerFlow	Applications	.	
W h a t	i s	a	S te p ?	
In	PowerFlow	,astep	is	ageneric	Python	class	that	performs	asingle	action,	such	as	caching	device	data:	
Steps	accept	arguments	called	input	parameters	.The	parameters	specify	the	values,	variables,	and	
configurations	to	use	when	executing	the	step.	Parameters	allow	steps	to	accept	arguments	and	allow	steps	to	be	
re-	used	in	multiple	integrations.	For	example,	you	can	use	the	same	step	to	query	both	the	local	system	and	
another	remote	system;	only	the	arguments,	such	as	hostname,	username,	and	password	change.	
What	is	aStep? 

What	is	aStep?	
You	can	view	and	edit	the	parameters	for	astep	by	opening	aPowerFlow	application	from	the	Applications	page,	
clicking	[Open	Editor	](	),	and	then	clicking	the	gear	icon	(	)on	astep.	The	Configuration	pane	for	that	
step	appears:	
A	step	can	pass	the	data	itgenerates	during	execution	to	asubsequent	step.	A	step	can	use	the	data	generated	by	
another	step.	Also,	you	can	add	test	data	to	the	step	and	click	the	down	arrow	next	to	the	[Run	]button	(	)and	
select	Custom	Run	to	run	test	data	for	that	step.	
PowerFlow	analyzes	the	required	parameters	for	each	step	and	alerts	you	ifany	required	parameters	are	missing	
before	PowerFlow	runs	the	step.	
Steps	are	grouped	into	the	following	types:¬†	
l	Standard	.Standard	steps	do	not	require	any	previously	collected	data	to	perform.	Standard	steps	are	
generally	used	to	generate	data	to	perform	atransformation	or	adatabase	insert.	These	steps	can	be	run	
independently	and	concurrently.	
l	Aggregated	.Aggregated	steps	require	data	that	was	generated	by	apreviously	run	step.	Aggregated	steps	
are	not	executed	by	PowerFlow	until	all	data	required	for	the	aggregation	is	available.	These	steps	can	be	run	
independently	and	concurrently.	
l	Trigger	.Trigger	steps	are	used	to	trigger	other	PowerFlow	applications.	These	steps	can	be	configured	to	be	
blocking	or	not.	
A	variety	of	generic	steps	are	available	from	ScienceLogic	,and	you	can	access	alist	of	steps	by	sending	aGET	
request	using	the	API¬†/steps	endpoint	.

W h a t	i s	a	P o w e r F l o w	A p p l i c a ti o n ?	
In	PowerFlow	,an	application	is	aJSON¬†file	that	specifies	which	steps	to	execute	and	the	order	in	which	to	
execute	those	steps.	An	application	also	defines	variables	and	provides	arguments	for	each	step.	
The	following	is	an	example	of	aPowerFlow	application:	
PowerFlow	application	JSON	objects	are	defined	by	configuration	settings,	steps	that	make	up	the	application,	
and	application-	wide	variables	used	as	parameters	for	each	step.	The	parameters	of	each	step	can	be	configured	
dynamically,	and	each	step	can	be	named	uniquely	while	still	sharing	the	same	underlying	class,	allowing	for	
maximum	re-	use	of	code.	
Applications	can	be	executed	through	the	REST	API	and	are	processed	as	an	asynchronous	task	in	PowerFlow	.	
During	processing	the	user	is	provided	aunique	task	ID	for	the	application	and	each	of	its	tasks.	Using	the	task	IDs,	
the	user	can	poll	for	the	status	of	the	application	and	the	status	of	each	individual	running	step	in	the	application.	
Executing	an	application	from	the	REST	API	allows	the	user	to	dynamically	set	one-	time	parameter	values	for	the	
variables	defined	in	the	application.	
The	required	parameters	of	applications	are	strictly	enforced,	and	PowerFlow	will	refuse	to	execute	the	application	
ifall	required	variables	are	not	provided.	
For	more	information	about	applications,	see	Managing	PowerFlow	Applications	.

Configuration	variables	are	defined	in	astand-	alone	JSON	file	called	aconfiguration	object	that	lives	on	the	
PowerFlow	system	and	can	be	accessed	by	all	PowerFlow	applications	and	their	steps.	
Each	global	variable	is	defined	as	aJSON	object	in	the	configuration.	Typically,	aconfiguration	object	looks	like	
the	following:
{	
""encrypted"":	true,	
""name"":	""var_	name"",	
""value"":""var_	value""	
}	
Configuration	objects	can	map	variables	from	the	SL1	platform	to	athird-	party	platform.	For	instance,	SL1	has	
device	classes	and	ServiceNow	has	CI	classes;	the	configuration	object	maps	these	two	sets	of	variables	together.	
Each	global	variable	in	the	configuration	has	the	option	of	being	encrypted.	The	values	of	encrypted	variables	are	
encrypted	within	PowerFlow	upon	upload	through	the	REST	API.	
For	more	information	about	configuration	objects,	see	Managing	Configuration	Objects	.

Instead	of	using	the	PowerFlow	user	interface,	you	can	create	steps,	applications,	and	configurations	in	your	own	
editor	and	then	upload	them	using	the	API	or	the	command	line	tool	(iscli).	
For	more	information,	see	the	SL1	PowerFlow	for	Developers	manual	.

With	the	2.0.0	release	of	the	PowerFlow	platform,	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	was	updated	to	match	the	8.12.0	
and	later	release	of	the	SL1	user	interface,	with	the	navigation	tabs	now	located	on	the	left-	hand	side	of	the	
window.¬†The	tabs	provide	access	to	the	following	pages:	Dashboard	,SyncPacks	,¬†Applications	,	
Configurations	,Reports	,and	Admin	Panel	.

You	can	log	in	to	PowerFlow	using	one	of	the	following	authorization	types:	
15 

16	
l	Local	Authentication	.The	same	local	Administrator	user	(isadmin	)is	supported	by	default	with	2.0.0	
installations.	Ifyou	are	migrating	from	aprevious	version	of	PowerFlow	to	version	2.0.0,	you	can	log	in	and	
authenticate	with	the	same	user	and	password.	
l	Basic	Authentication	.PowerFlow	2.0.0	continues	to	support	Basic	Authentication	as	well.	Because	
PowerFlow	PowerPacks	,diagnostic	scripts,	and	the	iscli	tool	continue	to	use	Basic	Authentication,	
ScienceLogic	does	not	recommend	disabling	Basic	Authentication	with	PowerFlow	version	2.0.0	or	later.	
l	OAuth	.¬†OAuth	lets	PowerFlow	administrators	use	their	own	authentication	providers	to	enforce	user	
authentication	and	lockout	policies.	Authentication	using	athird-	party	provider,	such	as	LDAP	or	Active	
Directory,	requires	additional	configuration.	For	optimal	security,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	disable	
the	local	Administrator	user	(isadmin	)and	exclusively	use	your	own	authentication	provider.	
Depending	on	the	authentication	used	by	your¬†	PowerFlow	system	,your	login	page	will	display	asingle	option	for	
logging	in,	or	more	than	one	option,	as	in	the	following	example:	
For	more	information	about	configuring	authorization	for	users,	see	Managing	Users	in	PowerFlow	.	
To	log	out	of	PowerFlow	,click	your	user	name	in	the	navigation	bar	in	the	top	right	of	any	window	and	select	Log

This	topic	describes	the	different	aspects	of	PowerFlow	architecture.	
P ow e r F l ow	C on t a i n e r ¬†A r c h i t e c t u r e	
PowerFlow	is	acollection	of	purpose-	built	containers	that	are	charged	to	pass	information	to	and	from	SL1	.	
Building	PowerFlow	architecture	in	containers	allows	you	to	add	more	processes	to	handle	the	workload	as	
needed.
The	following	diagram	describes	the	container	architecture	for	PowerFlow	:	
The	PowerFlow	includes	the	following	containers:	
l	GUI	.The	GUI¬†container	provides	the	user	interface	for	PowerFlow	.	
l	REST¬†API	.The¬†REST¬†API¬†container	provides	access	to	the	Content	Store	on	the	PowerFlow	instance.	
l	Content	Store	.The	Content¬†Store	container	is	basically	adatabase	service	that	contains	all	the	reusable	
steps,	applications,	and	containers	in	the	PowerFlow	instance.	
l	Step	Runners	.Step	Runner	containers	execute	steps	independently	of	other	Step	Runners.	All	Step	Runners	
belong	to	aWorker	Pool	and	can	run	steps	in	order,	based	on	the	instructions	in	the	applications.	By	default	
there	are	five	Step¬†Runners¬†	(worker	nodes)	include	in	the	PowerFlow	platform.¬†	PowerFlow	users	can	scale	up	
or	scale	down	the	number	of	worker	nodes,	based	on	the	workload	requirements.	
PowerFlow¬†Architecture 

PowerFlow¬†Architecture
I n t e g r a t i on	W or k f l ow	
The	following	high-	level	diagram	for	aServiceNow	Integration	provides	an	example	of	how	PowerFlow	
communicates	with	both	the	SL1	Central	Database	and	the	third-	party	(ServiceNow)	APIs:	
The	workflow	includes	the	following	components	and	their	communication	methods:	
l	SL1	Central	Database	.PowerFlow	communicates	with	the	SL1	database	over	port	7706.	
l	SL1	REST¬†API	.PowerFlow	communicates	with	the	SL1	REST¬†API	over	port	443.	
l	GraphQL	.PowerFlow	communicates	with	GraphQL	over	port	443.	
l	ServiceNow¬†Base	PowerPack	.In	this	example,	the¬†Run	Book	Automations	from	the	ServiceNow	Base	
PowerPack	(and	other¬†	SL1	¬†PowerPacks)	communicate	with	PowerFlow	over	port	443.	
l	PowerFlow	.PowerFlow	communicates	with	both	the	SL1	Central	Database	and	an	external	endpoint.	
l	ServiceNow	API	.In	this	example,	the	ServiceNow	applications	in	PowerFlow	communicate	with	the	
ServiceNow	API	over	port	443.	
NOTE:	PowerFlow	both	pulls	data	from	SL1	and	has	data	pushed	to	itfrom	SL1	.PowerFlow	both	sends	and	
retrieves	information	to	and	from	ServiceNow,	but	PowerFlow	is	originating	the	requests.	
H i g h -	A v a i l a b i l i t y ,	O f f -	s i t e	B a c k u p ,	a n d	P r ox y	A r c h i t e c t u r e	
You	can	deploy	PowerFlow	as	aHigh¬†Availability	cluster,	which	requires	at	least	three	nodes	to	achieve	automatic	
failover.	While	PowerFlow	can	be	deployed	as	asingle	node,	the	single-	node	option	does	not	provide	redundancy	
through	High¬†Availability.	PowerFlow	also	supports	off-	site	backup	and	connection	through	aproxy	server.	
22 

23
The	following	diagram	describes	these	different	configurations:	
l	High	Availability	for	PowerFlow	is	acluster	of	PowerFlow	nodes	with	aLoad¬†Balancer	managing	the	
workload.¬†In	the	above	scenario,	ifone	PowerFlow	node	fails,	the	workload	will	be	redistributed	to	the	
remaining	PowerFlow	nodes.¬†High	Availability	provides	local	redundancy.	For	more	information,	see	
Appendix	A:	Configuring	PowerFlow	for	High	Availability	.	
l	Off-	site	Backup	can	be	configured	by	using	PowerFlow	to	back	up	and	recover	data	in	the	Couchbase	
database.	The	backup	process	creates	abackup	file	and	sends	that	file	using	Secure	Copy	Protocol	(SCP)	to	
auser-	defined,	off-	site	destination	system.	You	can	then	use	the	backup	file	from	the	remote	system	and	
restore	its	content.	For	more	information,	see	Backing	up	Data	.	
l	A	Proxy	Server	is	adedicated	computer	or	software	system	running	as	an	intermediary.	The	proxy	server	in	
the	above	scenario	handles	the	requests	between	PowerFlow	and	the	third-	party	application.	For	more	
information,	see	Configuring	a	Proxy	Server	.	
In	addition,	you	can	deploy	PowerFlow	in	amulti-	tenant	environment	that	supports	multiple	customers	in	ahighly	
available	fashion.	After	the	initial	High	Availability	(HA)	core	services	are	deployed,	the	multi-	tenant	environment	
differs	in	the	deployment	and	placement	of	workers	and	use	of	custom	queues.	For	more	information,	see	
Appendix	B:	Configuring	PowerFlow	for	Multi-	tenant	Environments	.	
R e v i e w i n g	Y ou r	D e p l oy m e n t	A r c h i t e c t u r e	
Review	the	following	aspects	of	your	architecture	before	deploying	PowerFlow	:	
A.	How	many	SL1	stacks	will	you	use	to	integrate	with	the	third-	party	platform	(such	as	ServiceNow,¬†Cherwell,	
or	Restorepoint)?	
B.	What	is	agood	estimate	of	the	number	of	devices	across	all	of	your	SL1	stacks?	
C.	How	many	data	centers	will	you	use?	
PowerFlow¬†Architecture 

PowerFlow¬†Architecture	
D.	Specify	the	location	of	each	data	center.	
E.	What	is	the	latency	between	each	data	center?¬†	(Latency	must	be	less	than	80	ms.)	
F.	How	many	SL1	stacks	are	in	each	data	center?	
G.	Are	there	any	restrictions	on	data	replication	across	regions?	
H.	What	is	the	location	of	the	third-	party	platform	(if	applicable)?	
I.	What	is	the	VIP	for	Cluster	Node	Management?	
Based	on	the	above	list,	ScienceLogic	recommends	the	following	deployment	paths:	
l	For	question	A,	ifyou	answered	three	or	fewer	SL1	stacks,	consider	astandard	High-	Availability	
deployment.	For	more	information,	see	Appendix	A:	Configuring	PowerFlow	for	High	Availability	.	
l	For	question	A,	ifyou	answered	more	than	three	SL1	stacks	to	question	A,	consider	configuring	PowerFlow	
in	amulti-	tenant	configuration.	For	more	information,	see	Appendix	B:	Configuring	PowerFlow	for	Multi-	
tenant	Environments	.	
l	For¬†question	G,	ifyou	answered	""Yes	""to	data	replication	restrictions,	consider	the	following	deployment	
options:	
o	Deploy	separate	PowerFlow	clusters	per	region	.This	deployment	requires	more	management	of	
PowerFlow	clusters,	but	itensures	that	the	data	is	completely	separated	between	regions.	This	
deployment	also	ensures	that	ifasingle	region	goes	down,	you	only	lose	operations	for	that	region.	
o	Deploy	a	single	PowerFlow	cluster	in	the	restrictive	region	.This	deployment	is	easier	to	manage,	
as	you	are	only	dealing	with	asingle	PowerFlow	cluster.	As	an	example,	ifEurope	has	alaw	that	
requires	that	data	in	Europe	cannot	be	replicated	to	the	United	States,	but	that	law	does	not	prevent	
data	from	the	United	States	from	coming	into	Europe,	you	can	deploy	asingle	PowerFlow	cluster	in	
Europe	to	satisfy	the	law	requirements.	
l	Ifyou	are	deploying	amulti-	tenant	configuration,	check	to	see	ifyour	environment	meets	one	the	following:	
o	You	have	three	or	more	data	centers	and	the	latency	between	each	data	center	is	less	than	
80	ms	(question	E),	consider	deploying	amulti-	tenant	PowerFlow	where	each	node	is	in	aseparate	
data	center	to	ensure	data	center	resiliency.	This	deployment	ensures	that	ifasingle	data	center	goes	
down,	PowerFlow	will	remain	operational.	
o	You	have	only	two	data	centers	and	the	latency	between	data	centers	is	less	than	80	ms	,	
consider	deploying	amulti-	tenant	PowerFlow	where	two	nodes	are	in	one	data	center	and	the	other	
node	is	in	the	other	data	center.	This	deployment	does	not	ensure	data	center	resiliency,	but	itdoes	
provide	standard	High	Availability	ifasingle	node	goes	down.	Ifthe	data	center	with	one	node	goes	
down,	PowerFlow	will	remain	operational.	However,	ifthe	data	center	with	two	nodes	goes	down,	
PowerFlow	will	no	longer	remain	operational.	
o	You	have	only	two	data	centers	but	the	latency	between	data	centers	is	more	than	80	ms	.In	
this	situation,	you	can	still	deploy	amulti-	tenant	PowerFlow	,but	all	nodes	must	be	located	in	asingle	
data	center.	This	deployment	still	provides	standard	High	Availability	so	that,	ifasingle	node	goes	
down,	the	other	two	nodes	ensure	PowerFlow	operations.	Ifyou	require	more	resiliency	than	asingle-	
node	failure,	you	can	deploy	five	nodes,	which	will	ensure	resiliency	with	two	down	nodes.	However,	if	
the	data	center	goes	down,	PowerFlow	will	not	be	operational.

System	Requirements 

Additional	Prerequisites	for	PowerFlow	
NOTE:	The	default	internal	network	used	by	PowerFlow	services	is	172.21.0.1/16	.Please	ensure	that	this	
range	does	not	conflict	with	any	other	IP	addresses	on	your	network.	Ifneeded,	you	can	change	this	
subnet	in	the	docker-	compose.yml	file.	
TIP:	For	more	information	about	system	requirements	for	your	PowerFlow	environment,	see	the	System	
Requirements	page	at	the	ScienceLogic	Support	site	.	
H a r d e n e d	O p e r a t i n g	S y s t e m	
The	operating	system	for	PowerFlow	is	pre-	hardened	by	default,	with	firewalls	configured	only	for	essential	port	
access	and	all	services	and	processes	running	inside	Docker	containers,	communicating	on	asecure,	encrypted	
overlay	network	between	nodes.	Please	refer	to	the	table,	above,	for	more	information	on	essential	ports.	
You	can	apply	additional	Linux	hardening	policies	or	package	updates	as	long	as	Docker	and	its	network	
communications	are	operational.	
NOTE:	The	PowerFlow	operating	system	is	an	Oracle	Linux	distribution,	and	all	patches	are	provided	within	
the	standard	Oracle	Linux	repositories.	The	patches	are	not	provided	by	ScienceLogic.	
A d d i ti o n a l	P r e r e q u i s i te s	f o r	P o w e r F l o w	
To	work	with	PowerFlow	,ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	have	knowledge	of	the	following:

The	following	procedure	describes	how	to	install	PowerFlow	via	RPM	to	Amazon	Web	Service	(AWS)	EC2.	You	
can	also	install	PowerFlow	on	other	cloud-	based	environments,	such	as	Microsoft	Azure.	For	other	cloud-	based	
deployments,	the	process	is	essentially	the	same	as	the	following	steps:	PowerFlow	provides	the	containers,	and	
the	cloud-	based	environment	provides	the	operating	system	and	server.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	install	the	PowerFlow	system	in	acloud-	based	environment	using	amethod	other	than	an	ISO	
install,	you	are	responsible	for	setting	up	and	configuring	the	requirements	of	the	cloud-	based	
environment.	
You	can	install	PowerFlow	on	any	Oracle	Linux	7	or	later	operating	system,	even	in	the	cloud,	as	long	as	you	meet	
all	of	the	operating	system	requirements.	These	requirements	include	CPU,	memory,	Docker	and	adocker-	
compose	file	installed,	and	open	firewall	settings.	When	these	requirements	are	met,	you	can	install	the	RPM	and	
begin	to	deploy	the	stack	as	usual.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	install	the	PowerFlow	system	on	any	operating	system	other	than	Oracle	Linux	7,	ScienceLogic	
will	only	support	the	running	application	and	associated	containers.	ScienceLogic	will	not	assist	with	
issues	related	to	host	configuration	for	operating	systems	other	than	Oracle	Linux	7.	
To	install	asingle-	node	PowerFlow	via	RPM	to	acloud-	based	environment¬†	(using	AWS¬†as	an	example):	
1.	In	Amazon	Web	Service	(AWS)	EC2,	click	[Launch	instance	].The	Choose	an	Amazon	Machine	Image	
(AMI)	page	appears.	
TIP:	Ifyou	are	installing	PowerFlow	to	another	cloud-	based	environment,	such	as	Microsoft	Azure,	set	
up	the	operating	system	and	server,	and	then	go	to	step	7.	
2.	Deploy	anew	Oracle	Linux	7.6	virtual	machine	by	searching	for	OL7.6-	x86_	64-	HVM	in	the	Search	for	an	
AMI	field.	
3.	Click	the	results	link	for	Community	AMIs.

4.	Click	[Select	]for	avirtual	machine	running	Oracle	Linux	7.6	or	greater	for	installation.¬†The	following	image	
shows	an	example	of	an	OL7.6-	x86_	64-	HVM-	*AMI	file:	
5.	From	the	Choose	an	Instance	Type	page,	select	at	least	at2.xlarge	AMI	instance,	depending	on	your	
configuration:	
l	Single-	node	deployments	.The	minimum	is	t2.xlarge	(four	CPUs	with	16	GB	memory),	and	
ScienceLogic	recommends	t2.2xlarge	(8	CPUs	with	32	GB	memory).	
l	Cluster	deployments	.Cluster	deployments	depend	on	the	type	of	node	you	are	deploying.	Refer	to	the	
separate	multi-	tenant	environment	guide	for	more	sizing	information.¬†ScienceLogic	recommends	that	
you	allocate	at	least	50	GB	or	more	for	storage.	
6.	Go	to	the	Step	6:	Configure	Security	Group	page	and	define	the	security	group:	
l	Only	inbound	port	443	needs	to	be	exposed	to	any	of	the	systems	that	you	intend	to	integrate.	
l	For	PowerFlow	version	1.8.2	and	later,	port	8091	is	exposed	through	https	.ScienceLogic	
recommends	that	you	make	port	8091	available	externally	to	help	with	troubleshooting:

&&	sudo	yum	install	docker-	ce-	19.03.13-	3.el7.x86_	64.rpm	
NOTE:	You	will	need	to	update	both	instances	of	the	Docker	version	in	this	command	ifthere	is	amore	
recent	version	of	Docker	CE	on	the	Docker	Download	page:	
https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_	64/stable/Packages/	.	
WARNING:	You	might	need	to	remove	spaces	from	the	code	that	you	copy	and	paste	from	this	
manual.	For	example,	in	instances	such	as	the	wget	command,	above,	line	breaks	were	
added	to	long	lines	of	code	to	ensure	proper	pagination	in	the	document.	
9.	Create	the	Docker	group:	
sudo	groupadd	docker	
10.	Add	your	user	to	the	Docker	group:	
sudo	usermod	-aG	docker	$USER	
11.	Log	out	and	log	back	in	to	ensure	that	your	group	membership	is	re-	evaluated.	
12.	Run	the	following	commands	for	the	configuration	updates:

TIP:	To	view	alist	of	all	ports,	run	the	following	command:	firewall-	cmd	--list-	all	
14.	Copy	the	PowerFlow	RPM	to	the	instance	of	installation	and	install	the	RPM:	
sudo	yum	install	sl1-	powerflow	
systemctl	restart	docker	
15.	Create	apassword	for	PowerFlow	:	
sudo	printf	<password>	>	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	
where	<password>	is	anew,	secure	password.	
16.	Pull	and	start	iservices	to	start	PowerFlow	:	
/opt/iservices/scripts/pull_	start_	iservices.sh	
NOTE:	For	an	AWS	deployment,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	switch	to	an	Amazon	EC2	user	as	soon	
as	possible	instead	of	running	all	the	commands	on	root.	
NOTE:	For	aclustered	PowerFlow	environment,	you	must	install	the	PowerFlow	RPM	on	every	server	that	you	
plan	to	cluster	into	PowerFlow	.You	can	load	the	Docker	images	for	the	services	onto	each	server	
locally	by	running	/opt/iservices/scripts/pull_	start_	iservices.sh	.Installing	the	RPM	
onto	each	server	ensures	that	the	PowerFlow	containers	and	necessary	data	are	available	on	all	
servers	in	the	cluster.	
NOTE:	After	installation,	you	must	license	your¬†	PowerFlow	system	to	enable	all	of	the	features.	Licensing	is	
required	for	production	systems	only,	not	for	test	systems.	For	more	information,	see	Licensing

where:
full_	path_	of_	rpm	is	the	name	and	path	of	the	RPM	file,	such	as	sl1-	powerflow-	2.2.0-	1.x86_	64	.	
NOTE	:¬†If	you	are	running	PowerFlow	in	aclustered	environment,	install	the	RPM	on	all	nodes	in	the	
cluster	before	continuing	with	the	remaining	steps.	
5.	Ifthe	upgrade	process	recommends	restarting	Docker,	run	the	following	command:	
systemctl	restart	docker	
NOTE:	Ifyou	want	to	upgrade	your	services	in	place,	without	bringing	them	down,	you	may	skip	this	
step.	Please	note	that	skipping	this	step	might	take	the	services	slightly	longer	to	update.	
6.	After	the	RPM	is	installed,	run	the	following	Docker	command:	
docker	stack	rm	iservices	
7.	Re-	deploy	the	Docker	stack	to	update	the	containers:	
docker	stack	deploy	-c	/opt/iservices/scripts/docker-	compose.yml	iservices	
8.	After	you	re-	deploy	the	Docker	stack,	the	services	automatically	update	themselves.	Wait	afew	minutes	to	
ensure	that	all	services	are	updated	and	running	before	using	the	system.	You	can	use	the	visualizer	at	port

The	process	for	upgrading	to	version	2.2.0	of	PowerFlow	from	version	1.8.x	includes	the	following	required	steps:	
1.	Upgrade	the	host	packages	and	Python	3.6	(previous	versions	of	PowerFlow	used	Python	2.6).	
2.	Upgrade	to	Oracle	7.3	or	later.	
3.	Upgrade	to	Docker	version	18.09.2	or	later.	
NOTE:	PowerFlow	version	2.0.0	or	later	requires	the	docker-	ce	18.09.2	or	later	version	of	Docker.	
The	PowerFlow	ISO	installs	the	docker-	ce	19.03.13	version	of	Docker	by	default,	but	ifyou	
are	upgrading	to	this	version	from	the	RPM,	you	must	upgrade	Docker	before	you	upgrade	
PowerFlow	with	the	RPM.	
4.	Install	the	PowerFlow	upgrade	RPM.	
5.	Update	the	PowerFlow	system	from	Basic	Authentication	to	OAuth	2.0.	For	more	information,	see	
Configuring	Authentication	with	the	PowerFlow	.	
6.	Set	up	licensing	for	PowerFlow	.You	must	license	your¬†	PowerFlow	system	to	enable	all	of	the	features.	Ifyou	
are	not	deploying	PowerFlow	on	aproduction	or	pre-	production	environment,	you	can	skip	licensing.	For	
more	information,	see	Licensing	the¬†	PowerFlow	.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	upgrading	from	aversion	before	1.8.3,	be	sure	to	review	the	release	notes	for	the	older	
version	for	any	relevant	update	considerations	before	upgrading.	For	example,	there	is	asmall	port	
change	that	you	might	need	to	apply	ifyou	are	upgrading	acustomized	cluster	from	aversion	of	
PowerFlow	before	version	1.8.3.	
You	will	need	to	run	the	is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	script	to	perform	the	upgrade	steps	automatically.	The	script	
upgrades	the	PowerFlow	system	from	1.8.x	to	2.0.0	or	later.	
To	locate	the	upgrade	script:	
1.	Go	to	the	ScienceLogic	Support	site	at	https://support.sciencelogic.com/s/	.	
2.	Click	the	Product¬†Downloads	tab	and	select	PowerFlow	.The	PowerFlow	Release	page	appears.	
3.	Click	the	""PowerFlow	2.0""	link.	The	PowerFlow	2.0	Release	Version	page	appears.	
4.	In	the	Release	Files	section,	click	the	""1.8.X	to	2.	x.x	Upgrade""	link	for	the	script.	A	Release	File	page	
appears.	
5.	Click¬†	[Download	File	]at	the	bottom	of	the	Release	File	page.	The	is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	script	is	in	the	is_	
upgrade_	tools.zip	file.	
38 

39
The	upgrade	script	runs	the	following	steps:	
1.	Checks	to	see	ifthe	Oracle	version	is	greater	or	equal	to	7.3.	Ifnot,	the	script	stops	and	displays	amessage	
that	you	need	to	update	to	Oracle	7.3	or	later.	
2.	Sets	the	requirements	location	and	either	mounts	the	ISO	or	verifies	that	the	RPM	exists.	For	this	step,	the	
script	asks	ifthe	installation	will	be	offline	or	online,	and	italso	asks	you	for	the	location	of	the	RPM.	
3.	Installs	Python	3.6.	
4.	Installs	Docker	19.03.5.	
5.	Installs	the	PowerFlow	RPM.	
6.	Runs	the	pull_	start_	iservices.sh	script	to	deploy	and	initialize	PowerFlow	.	
7.	Ifthe	upgrading	process	was	offline,	cleans	the	changes	made	for	the	upgrading	process,	unmounts	the	ISO,	
and	removes	the	localiso.repo	file.	
To	run	the	upgrade	script:	
1.	Download	the	is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	script	and	add	itto	adirectory	on	the	PowerFlow	system	.	
2.	Download	the	sl1-	powerflow-	2.	x.x	-1.x86_	64.rpm	file	or	the	ISO	file	and	add	itto	adirectory	on	the	
PowerFlow	system	.Make	anote	of	this	directory,	because	you	will	need	itfor	Step	2	in	the	script.	
TIP:	Alternately,	instead	of	downloading	the	RPM	file,	you	can	specify	an	online	location	for	the	RPM	
file.	
3.	Ifneeded,	run	the	following	command	on	the	PowerFlow	system	to	give	the	script	execution	permissions:	
sudo	chmod	+x	is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	installing	aversion	of	PowerFlow	later	than	2.0.0,	you	will	need	to	update	the	
version	number	in	the	command,	above.	
4.	Change	directory	to	the	directory	containing	the	is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	script,	such	as	/home/isadmin/	,	
and	then	run	the	following	command	to	execute	the	upgrade	script:	
sudo	./is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	installing	aversion	of	PowerFlow	later	than	2.0.0,	you	will	need	to	update	the	
version	number	in	the	command,	above.	
5.	For	Step	2	of	the	script,	you	will	need	to	specify	ifyou	want	to	run	the	upgrade	online,	or	run	itoffline.	Type	""1""	
ifyou	have	Internet	access,	or	""2""	ifyou	want	to	run	the	update	offline.

6.	For	Step	2	of	the	script,	you	will	need	to	specify	the	location	of	the	RPM	or	ISO	file	for	2.0.	x.You	can	use	a	
location	on	the	PowerFlow	system	for	the	RPM¬†or	ISO	file,	or	an	online	location	for	the	RPM.	For	example:	
/home/isadmin/sl1-	powerflow-	2.2.0-	1.x86_	64.rpm	
7.	After	the	upgrade	script	completes,	perfor	m	the	following	steps	to	verify	the	upgrade:	
l	Review	the	docker-	compose.yml	file	and	ensure	that	all	environmental	changes	are	in	place.	
l	Ifthe	docker-	compose.yml	file	is	ready	to	be	deployed,	you	can	re-	deploy	the	PowerFlow	stack.	
l	After	the	PowerFlow	stack	is	up	and	running,	run	the	healthcheck	¬†action	with	the	pfctl	command-	line	
utility	to	verify	that	you	had	ahealthy	deployment.	
l	Ifneeded,	run	the	healthcheck	¬†action	with	the	pfctl	utility	to	automatically	fix	any	remaining	
inconsistencies	after	the	upgrade.	
TIP:	For	more	information	about	the	iservicecontrol	utility,	see	Using	the	pfctl	Command-	line	
Utility	.	
8.	To	view	updates	to	each	service	and	the	service	versions	for	services	throughout	the	whole	stack,	type	the	
following	at	the	command	line:	
docker	service	ls	
9.	As	needed,	update	the	PowerFlow	system	from	Basic	Authentication	to	OAuth	2.0.	For	more	information,	
see	Configuring	Authentication	with	PowerFlow	.	
10.	As	needed,	set	up	licensing	for	the	PowerFlow	.For	more	information,	see	Licensing	PowerFlow	.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	upgrading	aclustered	PowerFlow	environment	from	1.8.x	to	2.0.0	or	later,	see	Updating	
Cluster	Settings	when	Upgrading	from	1.8.x	to	2.0.0	or	Later	.

Instead	of	running	the	upgrade	script,	you	can	manually	upgrade	to	2.2.0	from	1.8.x,	following	the	detailed	
instructions	below.¬†	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	upgrading	from	aversion	before	1.8.3,	be	sure	to	review	the	release	notes	for	the	older	
version	for	any	relevant	update	considerations	before	upgrading.	For	example,	there	is	asmall	port	
change	that	you	might	need	to	apply	ifyou	are	upgrading	acustomized	cluster	from	aversion	of	
PowerFlow	before	version	1.8.3.

To	access	the	host	packages	online:	
40 

41	
1.	To	make	sure	that	all	repositories	can	access	the	required	host-	level	packages,	enable	the	necessary	
repositories	by	running	the	following	commands	on	the	PowerFlow	system	:	
yum	install	yum-	utils	
yum-	config-	manager	--enable	ol7_	latest	
yum-	config-	manager	--enable	ol7_	optional_	latest	
2.	Run	the	following	commands	to	update	and	install	the	host-	level	packages,	and	to	upgrade	to	Python	3.6:	
yum	remove	python34-	pip	python34-	setuptools	python3	
yum	--setopt=obsoletes=0	install	python36-	pip	python36	python36-	setuptools	
python36-	devel	openssl-	devel	gcc	make	kernel	
yum	update	
3.	Continue	the	upgrade	process	by	upgrading	to	Oracle	7.3	or	later.	
Ifyou	need	to	upgrade	the	host	packages	offline,	without	Internet	access,	you	can	mount	the	latest	PowerFlow	ISO	
file	onto	the	system	and	create	ayum	repository	configuration	that	points	to	the	local	mount	point	in	
/etc/yum.repos.d	.After	the	ISO¬†is	mounted,	you	can	import	the	latest	GNU	Privacy	Guard	(GPG)	key	used	by	
the	repository.	
To	access	the	host	packages	offline:	
1.	Mount	the	PowerFlow	ISO	onto	the	system:	
mount	-o	loop	/dev/cdrom	/mnt/tmpISMount	
2.	After	you	mount	the	ISO,	add	anew	repository	file	to	access	the	ISO	as	ifitwere	ayum	repository.	Create	a	
/etc/yum.repos.d/localiso.repo	file	with	the	following	contents:	
[localISISOMount]
name=Locally	mounted	IS	ISO	for	packages	
enabled=1
baseurl=file:///mnt/tmpISMount
gpgcheck=0
After	you	create	and	save	this	file,	the¬†Linux	system	can	install	packages	from	the	PowerFlow	ISO.	
3.	Optionally,	you	can	import	the	latest	GNU	Privacy	Guard	(GPG)	key	to	verify	the	packages	by	running	the	
following	command:	
rpm	--import	/mnt/repo_	keys/RPM-	GPG-	KEY-	Oracle	
rpm	--import	/mnt/tmpISMount/repo_	keys/RPM-	GPG-	KEY-	Docker-	ce

Follow	the	best	practices	for	upgrading	acluster	described	in	the	Docker	product	manual:	
https://docs.docker.com/ee/upgrade/#cluster-	upgrade-	best-	practices	.	
NOTE:	You	should	upgrade	all	manager	nodes	before	upgrading	worker	nodes.	Upgrading	manager	nodes	
sequentially	is	recommended	iflive	workloads	are	running	in	the	cluster	during	the	upgrade.	After	you	
upgrade	the	manager	nodes,	you	should	upgrade	worker	nodes,	and	then	the	Swarm	cluster	
upgrade	is	complete.	
Docker	recommends	that	you	drain	manager	nodes	of	any	services	running	on	those	nodes	Ifalive	migration	is	
expected,	all	workloads	must	be	running	on	swarm	workers,	not	swarm	managers,	or	the	manager	under	upgrade	
needs	to	be	completely	drained.	
Also,	anew	Python	Package	Index	(PyPI)	service	was	added	to	the	PowerFlow	stack.	When	deploying	PowerFlow	
in	acluster	setup,	and	not	using	network-	aware	volumes,	the	PyPI	server	must	be	""pinned""	to	aspecific	node	with	
constraints.	Pinning	the	PyPI	server	to	asingle	node	ensures	that	its	persistent	volume	containing	the	
Synchronization	PowerPacks	will	always	be	available	to	PowerFlow	.	
S t e p	4 .	I n s t a l l i n g	t h e	P o w e r F l o w	R P M	
To	update	PowerFlow	using	the	RPM:	
1.	Download	the	PowerFlow	RPM	and	copy	the	RPM	file	to	the	PowerFlow	system.	
2.	Log	in	as	isadmin	with	the	appropriate	(root)	password.	You	must	be	root	to	upgrade	the	RPM	file.	
3.	Type	the	following	at	the	command	line:	
rpm	‚ÄìUvh	full_	path_	of_	rpm	
where	full_	path_	of_	rpm	is	the	full	path	and	name	of	the	RPM	file.	
4.	Run	the	pull_	start_	iservices.sh	script	to	deploy	and	initialize	2.	x.x	:	
/opt/iservices/scripts/pull_	start_	iservices.sh	
WARNING:	Do	not	run	the	pull_	start_	iservices.sh	script	ifyou	are	using	PowerFlow	in	aclustered	
environment.	
5.	To	view	updates	to	each	service	and	the	service	versions	for	services	throughout	the	whole	stack,	type	the	
following	at	the	command	line:	
docker	service	ls	
6.	Verify	that	each	service	now	uses	the	new	version	of	PowerFlow	.

7.	As	needed,	update	the	PowerFlow	system	from	Basic	Authentication	to	OAuth	2.0.	For	more	information,	
see	Configuring	Authentication	with	PowerFlow	.	
8.	As	needed,	set	up	licensing	for	PowerFlow	.For	more	information,	see	Licensing	PowerFlow	.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	upgrading	aclustered	PowerFlow	environment	from	1.8.x	to	2.0.0	or	later,	see	Updating

After	upgrading	PowerFlow	cluster	nodes	from	1.8.x	to	2.0.0	or	later,	you	need	to	verify	the	following	details	in	the	
docker-	compose	file:	
1.	Verify	that	the	pypiserver	is	pinned	to	the	node	that	contains	the	Synchronization	PowerPacks	:	
node.hostname	==	<node	hostname	from	docker	node	ls>	.	
2.	Verify	that	the	dexserver	is	replicated	three	times	to	keep	the	pypiserver	service	from	moving	from	one	node	
to	another	and	so	you	no	longer	have	the	persisted	Synchronization	PowerPack	storage.	
You	can	use	the	healthcheck	action	with	the	pfctl	command-	line	utility	to	validate	the	docker-	compose	file.	The	
healthcheck	action	will	show	amessage	ifthe	pypiserver	or	dexserver	services	are	not	well-	configured	in	the	
docker-	compose	file.	You	can	fix	these	issues	manually,	or	you	can	fix	them	using	the	autoheal	action	with	the	
pfctl	utility.	The	utility	corrects	the	docker-	compose	file	and	copies	itto	all	the	nodes	in	the	cluster	environment.	
NOTE:	When	using	the	version	of	the	pfctl	command-	line	utility	that	comes	with	PowerFlow	version	2.1.0	or	
later,	the	autocluster	action	validates	and	fixes	the	pypiserver	and	dexserver	services	definitions	in	
the	docker-	compose	file.

many	resources	and	starving	other	workers.	You	can	apply	these	limits	in	two	ways:	
l	Set	ahard	memory	limit	in	Docker	(this	is	the	default)	
l	Set	asoft	memory	limit	in	the	worker	environment	
S e t t i n g	a	H a r d	M e m or y	L i m i t	i n	D oc k e r	
Setting	amemory	limit	for	the	worker	containers	in	your	docker-	compose.yml	file	sets	ahard	limit.	Ifyou	set	a	
memory	limit	for	the	workers	in	the	docker-	compose	file	and	aworker	exceeds	the	limit,	the	container	is	
terminated	via	SIGKILL.	
Ifthe	currently	running	task	caused	memory	usage	to	go	above	the	limit,	that	task	might	not	be	completed,	and	the	
worker	container	is	terminated	in	favor	of	anew	worker.	This	setting	helps	to	prevent	aworker	from	endlessly	
running	and	consuming	all	memory	on	the	PowerFlow	system.	
You	can	configure	the	hard	memory	limit	in	the	steprunner	service	of	the	docker-	compose.yml	file:	
deploy:	
resources:	
limits:	
memory:	2G	
S e t t i n g	a	S of t	M e m or y	L i m i t	i n	t h e	W or k e r	E n v i r on m e n t	
You	can	set	the	memory	limit	for	aworker	application,	and	not	at	the	Docker	level.	Setting	the	memory	limit	at	the	
application	level	differs	from	the	hard	memory	limit	in	Docker	in	that	ifaworker	exceeds	the	specified	memory	
limit,	that	worker	is	not	immediately	terminated	via	SIGKILL.	
Instead,	ifaworker	exceeds	the	soft	memory	limit,	the	worker	waits	until	the	currently	running	task	is	completed	to	
recycle	itself	and	start	anew	process.	As	aresult,	tasks	will	complete	ifaworker	crosses	the	memory	limit,	but	ifa	
task	is	running	infinitely	with	amemory	leak,	that	task	might	consume	all	memory	on	the	host.	
NOTE:	The	soft	memory	limit	is	less	safe	from	memory	leaks	than	the	hard	memory	limit.	
You	can	configure	the	soft	memory	limit	with	the	worker	environment	variables.	The	value	is	in	KiB	(1024	bytes).	
Also,	each	worker	instance	contains	three	processes	for	running	tasks.	The	memory	limit	applies	to	each	individual	
instance,	and	not	the	container	as	awhole.	For	example,	a2	GB	memory	limit	for	the	container	would	translate	to	
2	GB	divided	by	three,	or	about	700	MB	for	each	worker:	
steprunner:	
image:	repository.auto.sciencelogic.local:5000/is-	worker:1.8.1	
environment:	
additional_	worker_	args:	'	--max-	memory-	per-	child	700000'

Changing	the	PowerFlow	System	Password	
C h a n g i n g	th e	P o w e r F l o w	S y s te m	P a s s w o r d	
The	PowerFlow	system	uses	two	primary	passwords.	For	consistency,	both	passwords	are	the	same	after	you	install	
PowerFlow	,but	you	can	change	them	to	separate	passwords	as	needed.	
PowerFlow	uses	the	following	passwords:	
l	The	PowerFlow	Administrator	(isadmin	)user	password	.This	is	the	password	that	you	set	during	the	
PowerFlow	ISO¬†installation	process	,and	itis	only	used	by	the	default	local	Administrator	user	(isadmin	).	
You	use	this	password	to	log	into	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	and	to	verify	API	requests	and	database	
actions.	This	password	is	set	as	both	the	""Linux	host	isadmin""	user	and	in	the	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	file	that	
is	mounted	into	the	PowerFlow	stack	as	a""Docker	secret"".	Because	itis	mounted	as	asecret,	all	necessary	
containers	are	aware	of	this	password	in	asecure	manner.	Alternatively,	you	can	enable	third-	party	
authentication,	such	as	LDAP	or	AD,	and	authenticate	with	credentials	other	than	isadmin.	However,	you	will	
need	to	set	the	user	policies	for	those	LDAP	users	first	with	the	default	isadmin	user.	For	more	information,	
see	Managing	Users	in	PowerFlow	.	
l	The	Linux	Host	OS	SSH	password	.This	is	the	password	you	use	to	SSH	and	to	log	in	to	isadmin.	You	can	
change	this	password	using	the	standard	Linux	passwd	command	or	another	credential	management	
application	to	manage	this	user.	You	can	also	disable	this	Linux	user	and	add	your	own	user	ifyou	want.	The	
PowerFlow	containers	and	applications	do	not	use	or	know	this	Linux	login	password,	and	this	password	does	
not	need	to	be	the	same	between	nodes	in	acluster.	This	is	astandard	Linux	Host	OS	password.	
To	change	the	PowerFlow	Administrator	(isadmin	)user	password:	
1.	You	can	change	the	mounted	isadmin	password	secret	(which	is	used	to	authenticate	via	API	by	default)	and	
the	Couchbase	credentials	on	the	PowerFlow	stack	by	running	the	ispasswd	script	on	any	node	running	
PowerFlow	in	the	stack:	
/opt/iservices/scripts/ispasswd	
2.	Follow	the	prompts	to	reset	the	password.	The	password	must	be	at	least	six	characters	and	no	more	than	24	
characters,	and	all	special	characters	are	supported.	
NOTE:	Running	the	ispasswd	script	automatically	changes	the	password	for	all	PowerFlow	
application	actions	that	require	credentials	for	the	isadmin	user.	
3.	Ifyou	have	multiple	nodes,	copy	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	file,	which	was	just	updated	by	the	ispasswd	script,	
to	all	other	manager	nodes	in	the	cluster.	You	need	to	copy	this	password	file	across	all	nodes	in	case	you	
deploy	from	adifferent	node	than	the	node	where	you	changed	the	password.	The	need	to	manually	copy	the	
password	to	all	nodes	will	be	removed	in	afuture	release	of	PowerFlow	.	
NOTE:	IfaPowerFlow	user	makes	multiple	incorrect	login	attempts,	PowerFlow	locks	out	the	user.	To	unlock	
the	user,	run	the	following	command:	unlock_	user	-u	<username>

To	configure	PowerFlow	to	use	aproxy	server:	
1.	Either	go	to	the	console	of	the	PowerFlow	system	or	use	SSH	to	access	the	PowerFlow	server.	
2.	Log	in	as	isadmin	with	the	appropriate	password.	
3.	Using	atext	editor	like	vi,	edit	the	file	/opt/iservices/scripts/docker-	compose-	override.yml	.	
NOTE:	PowerFlow	uses	adocker-	compose-	override.yml	file	to	persistently	store	user-	specific	
configurations	for	containers,	such	as	proxy	settings,	replica	settings,	additional	node	settings,	
and	deploy	constraints.	The	user-	specific	changes	are	kept	in	this	file	so	that	they	can	be	re-	
applied	when	the	/opt/iservices/docker-	compose.yml	file	is	completely	replaced	on	an	
RPM	upgrade,	ensuring	that	no	user-	specific	configurations	are	lost.	
4.	In	the	environment	section	of	the	steprunner	service,	add	the	following	lines:	
services:	
steprunner:	
environment:	
https_	proxy:¬†""<proxy_	host>""	
http_	proxy:	""<proxy_	host>""	
no_	proxy:	"".isnet""	
5.	In	the	environment	section	of	the	syncpack_	steprunner	service,	add	the	following	lines:	
services:	
syncpack_	steprunner:	
environment:	
https_	proxy:¬†""<proxy_	host>""	
http_	proxy:	""<proxy_	host>""	
no_	proxy:	"".isnet""	
6.	Save	the	settings	in	the	file	and	then	run	the	/opt/iservices/compose_	override.sh	script.	
NOTE:	The	compose_	override.sh	script	validates	that	the	configured	docker-	compose.yml	and	
docker-	compose-	override.yml	files	are	syntactically	correct.	Ifthe	settings	are	correct,	the	
script	applies	the	settings	to	your	existing	docker-	compose.yml	file	that	is	used	to	actually	
deploy.	
7.	Re-	deploy	the	steprunners	to	use	this	change	by	typing	the	following	commands:	
docker	service	rm	iservices_	steprunner	
docker	stack	deploy	-c	/opt/iservices/scripts/docker-	compose.yml	iservices

C o n f i g u r i n g	S e c u r i ty	S e tti n g s	
This	topic	explains	how	to	change	the	HTTPS	certificate	used	by	PowerFlow	,and	italso	describes	password	and	
encryption	key	security.	
C h a n g i n g	t h e	H T T P S	C e r t i f i c a t e	
The	PowerFlow	user	interface	only	accepts	communications	over	HTTPS.	By	default,	HTTPS	is	configured	using	an	
internal,	self-	signed	certificate.	
You	can	specify	the	HTTPS	certificate	to	use	in	your	environment	by	mounting	the	following	two	files	in	the	user	
interface	(gui)	container:	
l	/etc/iservices/is_	key.pem	
l	/etc/iservices/is_	cert.pem	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	using	aclustered	configuration	for	PowerFlow	,you	will	need	to	copy	the	key	and	certificate	
to	the	same	location	on	the	node.	
To	specify	the	HTTPS	certificate	to	use	in	your	environment:	
1.	Copy	the	key	and	certificate	to	the	PowerFlow	host.	
2.	Modify	the	/opt/iservices/scripts/docker-	compose-	override.yml	file	and	mount	avolume	to	the	gui	
service.	The	following	code	is	an	example	of	the	volume	specification:	
volumes:	
-	""<path	to	IS	key>	:/etc/iservices/is_	key.pem""	
-	""<path	to	IS	certificate>	:/etc/iservices/is_	cert.pem""	
3.	Run	the	following	script	to	validate	and	apply	the	change:	
/opt/iservices/scripts/compose_	override.sh	
4.	Re-	deploy	the	gui	service	by	running	the	following	commands:	
docker	service	rm	iservices_	gui	
/opt/iservices/scripts/pull_	start_	iservices.sh	
U s i n g	P a s s w or d	a n d	E n c r y p t i on	K e y	S e c u r i t y	
When	you	install	the	PowerFlow	platform,	you	specified	the	PowerFlow	root	password.	This	root	password	is	also	
the	default	isadmin	password:	
l	The	root/admin	password	is	saved	in	aroot	read-	only	file	here:	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	
l	A	backup	password	file	is	also	saved	in	aroot	read-	only	file	here:	/opt/iservices/backup/is_	pass	
52 

53
The	user-	created	root	password	is	also	the	default	PowerFlow	password	for	couchbase	(:8091)	and	all	API	
communications.	The	PowerFlow	platform	generates	aunique	encryption	key	for	every	platform	installation:	
l	The	encryption	key	exists	in	aroot	read-	only	file	here:	/etc/iservices/encryption_	key	
l	A	backup	encryption	key	file	is	also	saved	in	aroot	read-	only	file	here:	/opt/iservices/backup/encryption_	
key	
You	can	use	the	encryption	key	to	encrypt	all	internal	passwords	and	user-	specified	data.	You	can	encrypt	any	
value	in	aconfiguration	by	specifying	""encrypted"":	true,	when	you	POST	that	configuration	setting	to	the	API.	
There	is	also	an	option	in	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	to	select	encrypted	.Encrypted	values	use	the	same	
randomly-	generated	encryption	key.	
User-	created	passwords	and	encryption	keys	are	securely	exposed	in	the	Docker	containers	using	Docker	secrets	at	
https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/	to	ensure	secure	handling	of	information	between	containers.	
NOTE	:The	encryption	key	must	be	identical	between	two	PowerFlow	systems	ifyou	plan	to	migrate	from	one	
to	another.¬†The	encryption	key	must	be	identical	between	High	Availability	or	Disaster	Recovery	
systems	as	well.	
TIP:	PowerFlow	supports	all	special	characters	in	passwords.

This	chapter	describes	how	to	configure	authentication	for	PowerFlow	to	allow	access	to	multiple	users	with	a	
variety	of	roles	and	permissions.	
This	chapter	also	describes	how	to	use	the	Admin	Panel	page¬†	(	)to	manage	user	group	access	to	the	
PowerFlow	user	interface.¬†Only	users	with	the	Administrator	role	for	the	PowerFlow	system	can	edit	this	page.	
This	chapter	covers	the	following	topics:	
Configuring	Authentication	with	PowerFlow	59

C o n f i g u r i n g	A u th e n ti c a ti o n	w i th	P o w e r F l o w	
SL1	PowerFlow	version	2.0.0	or	later	supports	the	following	authentication	methods:	
l	Local	Authentication	.The	same	local	Administrator	user	(isadmin	)is	supported	by	default	with	2.0.0	or	
later	installations.	Ifyou	are	migrating	from	aprevious	version	of	PowerFlow	to	version	2.0.0	or	later,	you	can	
log	in	and	authenticate	with	the	same	user	and	password.	
l	Basic	Authentication	.PowerFlow	2.0.0	or	later	continues	to	support	Basic	Authentication	as	well.	Because	
the	PowerFlow	PowerPacks	,diagnostic	scripts,	and	the	iscli	tool	continue	to	use	Basic	Authentication,	
ScienceLogic	does	not	recommend	disabling	Basic	Authentication	with	PowerFlow	version	2.0.0	or	later.	
l	OAuth	.¬†Lets	PowerFlow	administrators	use	their	own	authentication	providers	to	enforce	user	authentication	
and	lockout	policies.	Authentication	using	athird-	party	provider,	such	as	LDAP	or	Active	Directory,	requires	
additional	configuration.	For	optimal	security,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	disable	the	local	
Administrator	user	(isadmin	)and	exclusively	use	your	own	authentication	provider.	
Regardless	of	authentication	strategy,	authorization	and	role	access	is	configured	separately,	based	on	user	or	user	
group.¬†For	more	information,	see	Creating	a	User¬†Group	in	PowerFlow	.	
The	following	topics	describe	how	to	configure	each	authentication	strategy	for	PowerFlow	:	
l	User	Interface	Login¬†Administrator	User	(default)	
l	Basic	Authentication	Using	a	REST	Administrator	User	(default)	
l	User	Interface	Login	Using	a	Third-	party	Authentication	Provider	
l	OAuth	Client	Authentication	Using	a	Third-	party	Provider	
U s e r	I n t e r f a c e	L og i n	A d m i n i s t r a t or	U s e r	( D e f a u l t )	
The	local	Administrator	user	is	the	default	login	user	for	PowerFlow	.The	username	is	""isadmin""	by	default,	and	the	
password	gets	set	during	the	ISO	installation	process.	The	PowerFlow	administrator	can	change	the	default	
password	or	the	Administrator	user.	
This	authentication	strategy	allows	authentication	of	the	local	Administrator	user	through	the	PowerFlow	user	
interface.	The	""isadmin""	user	is	the	local	Administrator	by	default,	but	you	can	change	the	username	of	the	local	
Administrator	to	something	other	than	""isadmin""	ifneeded.	
WARNING:	Ifyou	disable	this	authentication	strategy,	you	must	first	configure	an	alternative	provider	to	
appropriately	authenticate	to	the	PowerFlow	system	and	also	configure	auser	or	user	group	
policy	that	has	the	Administrator	role.	Ifyou	disable	this	user	without	asecond	authentication	
provider	configured,	PowerFlow	will	not	be	able	to	authenticate	any	users.	
To	disable	this	user,	set	the	following	environment	variable	in	the	/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	file:	
BASIC_	AUTH:	False	
Configuring	Authentication	with	PowerFlow 

Configuring	Authentication	with	PowerFlow	
To	change	the	local	Administrator	username,	set	the	following	environment	variable	in	the	
/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	file:	
BASIC_	AUTH_	USER:	""username""	
NOTE:	Before	changing	the	local	Administrator	username,	make	sure	that	the	user	has	Administrator	
permissions	in	the	PowerFlow	system.	For	more	information,	see	User¬†Groups,	Roles,	
and¬†Permissions	.	
ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	use	the	same	system-	wide	password	for	the	local	Administrator	user,	which	is	
located	in	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	.To	change	this	password,	run	the	/opt/iservices/scripts/ispasswd	script.	
Alternatively,	you	can	set	adifferent	password	for	the	local	Administrator	user	by	setting	the	following	environment	
variable	in	/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	:	
BASIC_	AUTH_	PASSWORD:	""BASIC_	AUTH_	PASSWORD""

Basic	Authentication	through	aREST	administrator	user	enables	the	local	Administrator	user	to	access	the	
PowerFlow	API	through	REST	using	Basic	Authentication.	This	authentication	strategy	enables	users	to	make	
queries	through	the	API	using	<isadmin:password>	basic	authentication.	
This	Basic	Authentication	is	enabled	by	default	in	PowerFlow	2.0.0	or	later.	The	REST	administrator	uses	the	same	
environment	variables	and	configuration	as	the	user	interface	login	Administrator	user	.	
Basic	Authentication	is	limited	to	only	the	local	Administrator	user.	Ifyour	PowerFlow	system	is	configured	to	use	a	
different	authentication	provider,	you	must	authenticate	using	OAuth	2.0	and	abearer	token.	For	more	
information,	see	OAuth	Client	Authentication	Using	an	Internal	Provider	.	
WARNING:	This	Basic	Authentication	user	is	enabled	by	default	to	support	backward	compatibility	with	any	
scripts	or	queries	running	against	the	versions	of	PowerFlow	before	2.0.0.	Ifyou	disable	this

This	authentication	strategy	lets	you	set	up	user	authentication	through	athird-	party	authentication	provider,	such	
as	LDAP	or	Active¬†Directory	(AD).	You	configure	additional	providers	and	their	connectors	in	the	
/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	file,	following	the	Dex	connector	configuration	described	below.	This	authentication	
strategy	is	automatically	disabled	when	no	connectors	are	present	in	the	configuration.	
After	you	configure	the	providers,	users	can	select	one	of	the	defined	providers	or	the	local	Administrator	
authentication,	and	authenticate	using	that	provider.

When	using	this	authentication	strategy,	the	PowerFlow	system	automatically	retrieves	the	LDAP¬†or	AD	groups	to	
which	the	user	belongs.	You	can	use	these	groups	can	be	used	to	apply	specific	role	permissions.	For	more	
information,	see	Role-	based	Access	Control	(RBAC)	Configuration	.	
NOTE:	By	default,	no	third-	party	authentication	providers	are	configured	in	PowerFlow	.	
Credentials	for	user	authentication	exist	only	with	the	third-	party	authentication	provider,	and	the	credentials	are	
not	imported	into	PowerFlow	.The	only	information	that	PowerFlow	retains	for	these	users	are	the	roles	and	
permissions	attached	to	the	user	names.	
To	configure	athird-	party	authentication	provider:	
1.	Go	to	https://github.com/dexidp/dex#connectors	and	locate	the	connector	type,	such	as	LDAP	or	SAML	2.0,	
that	you	would	like	to	use	for	authentication.	
2.	Click	the	link	for	the	connector	type	to	view	example	configuration	options	for	the	connector.	
3.	Update	the	/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	file	and	add	aDEX_	CONNECTORS	section	with	the	configuration	
for	the	connector	you	want	to	use.	The	DEX_	CONNECTORS	section	in	the	isconfig.yml	file	is	identical	to	
the	CONNECTORS	section	described	in	the	Dex	documentation.	
4.	Re-	deploy	the	PowerFlow	stack	and	check	for	errors	in	docker	service	logs	iservices_	dexserver	.Ifthe	
dexserver	starts	successfully	and	PowerFlow	is	running,	then	PowerFlow	has	accepted	the	configuration.	
5.	Next,	log	in	to	the	PowerFlow	system	with	auser	provided	by	the	newly	configured	authentication.	
6.	Look	for	errors	with	searching	users	or	user	groups	in	the	user	interface	or	the	Docker	service	logs.	
For	reference,	the	following	is	an	example	/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	file	with	an	Active	Directory	authentication

OAuth	Client	Authentication	provides	user	authentication	with	aconfigured	third-	party	provider,	such	as	LDAP¬†or	
AD.	This	allows	users	to	use	clients	authenticating	with	OAuth	2.0	bearer	tokens	to	authenticate	against	their	
configured	provider.	
In	PowerFlow	2.0.0	or	later,	the	OAuth	Client	Authentication	strategy	is	automatically	enabled	when	a	
authentication	provider	is	configured.¬†You	can	configure	this	strategy	using	the	same	parameters	as	the	User	
Interface	Login	Using	a	Third-	party	Authentication	Provider	.	
The	PowerFlow	system	provides	discovery	endpoints	for	all	OAuth	2.0	required	endpoints.	The	discovery	address	
is:	https://IS-	IP:5556/dex/.well-	known/openid-	configuration	.	
Using	these	discovery	endpoints,	you	can	use	an	OAuth	2.0	client	to	generate	asecure	token	using	athird-	party	
authentication	provider.	You	can	use	the	generated	secure	token	as	abearer	authentication	token	(specified	in	
request	headers)	to	authenticate	and	make	requests.	
The	client_	secret	and	session_	secret	are	unique,	randomly	generated	strings	generated	for	each	IS	deployment.	
To	obtain	an	OAuth	2.0	token,	you	will	need	these	values,	which	you	can	find	in	the	/etc/iservices/isconfig.yml	
file.

PowerFlow	2.0.0	or	later	supports	OAuth	2.0	with	OpenID	Connect,	which	lets	PowerFlow	administrators	use	
third-	party	authentication	providers,	such	as	LDAP	or	Active	Directory,	to	enforce	user	authentication	and	lockout	
policies.
PowerFlow	continues	to	support	Basic	Authentication	as	well,	but	PowerFlow	no	longer	enforces	automatically	
locking	out	the	isadmin	user	ifthat	user	has	too	many	failed	login	attempts.	
Ifyou	are	concerned	about	removing	the	lockout	functionality	for	the	isadmin	user,	you	can	perform	one	of	the	
following	actions:	
1.	Change	the	default	username	from	isadmin	to	adifferent	name	to	prevent	brute	force	type	attacks	on	the	
isadmin	user.	
2.	Disable	Basic	Authentication	and	use	third-	party	authentication	providers,	such	as	your	company's	LDAP	
server,	to	enforce	user	authentication	and	lockout	policies.	
NOTE:	Before	disabling	Basic	Authentication,	make	sure	that	all	scripts	or	tools	that	query	the	PowerFlow	API	
have	been	updated	to	use	OAuth	2.0.

Regardless	of	the	authentication	method	you	have	chosen	to	use,	the	role-	based	permissions	assigned	to	users	is	
applied	in	the	same	way.

Additional	information	about	roles	and	permissions	in	PowerFlow	:	
l	Roles	in	PowerFlow	are	automatically	assigned	to	auser	based	on	the	user's	group	with	the	external	provider	
(such	as	LDAP	or	AD)	.	
l	IfaPowerFlow	system	does	not	have	an	external	provider	configured,	such	as	LDAP¬†or	Active	Directory,	that

other	user	passwords	are	saved	in	the	third-	party	authentication	provider	configured	for	PowerFlow	.	
l	The	authentication	configuration	used	by	PowerFlow	is	also	supported	in	SL1	.	
l	API	queries	made	by	users	will	also	be	checked	for	proper	authorization.	
l	The	PowerFlow	administrator	can	configure	which	users	are	in	which	roles.	
l	The	PowerFlow	administrator	can	test	and	configure	the	LDAP¬†and	Active	Directory	settings	to	ensure	that	the

A	Synchronization	PowerPack	contains	all	of	the	code	and	logic	needed	to	perform	integrations	on	the	PowerFlow	
platform.	A	Synchronization	PowerPack	is	saved	as	aPython	.whl	file,	and	ittypically	includes	Python	steps	that	are	
listed	in	applications,	and	then	encapsulated	within	configurations:	
You	can	access	the	latest	steps,	applications,	and	configurations	for	PowerFlow	or	athird-	party	integration,	such	as	
ServiceNow,	by	downloading	the	most	recent	Synchronization	PowerPack	for	that	integration	from	ScienceLogic.	
You	can	access	all	Synchronization	PowerPacks	on	the	SyncPacks	page.	
A	Synchronization	PowerPack	is	highly	customizable,	and	you	can	modify	the	contents	of	aSynchronization	
PowerPack	to	meet	your	business	needs,	instead	of	changing	your	SL1	configuration.	You	can	categorize	and	
segment	your	business	integration	solutions	using	aSynchronization	PowerPack	.	
Synchronization	PowerPacks	let	you	distribute	content	to	simplify	installations,	upgrades,	and	maintenance	of	
integration	solutions.	Just	like	PowerPacks	,you	can	also	share	Synchronization	PowerPacks	.IfaPowerFlow	user	
creates	aSynchronization	PowerPack	,that	user	can	share	the	Synchronization	PowerPack	with	other	users	through

Managing	Configuration	Objects	
O v e r v i e w
This	chapter	describes	how	to	use	the	Configurations	page	(	)to	create	or	use	aconfiguration	object	that	
contains	aset	of	variables	that	all	steps	and	applications	can	use.	
This	chapter	covers	the	following	topics:	
What	is	a	Configuration	Object?	120

W h a t	i s	a	C o n f i g u r a ti o n	O b j e c t?	
A	configuration	object	is	astand-	alone	JSON	file	that	lives	on	the	PowerFlow	system	.A	configuration	object	
supplies	the	login	credentials	and	other	global	variables	that	can	be	used	by	all	steps	and	applications	in	
PowerFlow	.Configuration	objects	allow	the	same	application	to	be	deployed	in	multiple	PowerFlow	instances,	
with	different	configurations.	
Configuration	objects	can	map	variables	from	SL1	to	athird-	party	platform.	For	instance,	SL1	has	device	classes	
and	various	third-	party	platforms	have	CI	classes;	the	configuration	object	would	map	these	two	variables.	
You	can	create	and	edit	configuration	objects	on	the	Configurations	page	of	the	PowerFlow	user	interface.	After	
you	create	the	configuration	object,	itappears	in	the	Configuration	drop-	down	on	the	Configuration	pane	of	
the	Applications	page.	Before	you	can	run	an	application,	you	must	select	aconfiguration	object	and	""align""	that	
configuration	object	with	the	application.	
TIP:	You	can	select	none	from	the	Configuration	drop-	down	to	clear	or	""un-	align""¬†the	selected	configuration	
object	from	an	application.	Also,	ifyou	did	not	select	aconfiguration	object	when	editing	fields	on	the	
Configuration	pane,	the	previously	set	configuration	object	will	remain	aligned	(if	there	was	apreviously	
set	configuration	object).	
You	can	include	the	config.	prefix	with	avariable	to	tell	PowerFlow	to	use	aconfiguration	file	to	resolve	the	
variable.	Ifyou	want	to	re-	use	the	same	settings	between	applications,	such	as	hostname	and	credentials,	define	
configuration	variables.	
What	is	aConfiguration	Object? 

What	is	aConfiguration	Object?	
The	Configurations	page	(	)displays	alist	of	available	configurations.	From	this	page	you	can	create	and	edit	
configuration	objects:	
You	can	search	for	aspecific	configuration	object	by	typing	the	name	of	that	configuration	in	the	Search	field	at	the	
top	of	the	Configurations	page.¬†The	user	interface	filters	the	list	as	you	type.	Click	the	[Actions	]button	(	)for	a	
configuration	object	to	edit	or	delete	that	object.	
TIP:	Click	the	down	arrow	icon	(	)for	aconfiguration	object	to	see	which	applications	are	currently	
""aligned""	with	that	configuration	object.

When	creating	or	editing	aconfiguration	object	on	the	Configurations	page,	the	name-	value	pairs	in	the	
Configuration	Data	section	display	in	fields	by	default	instead	of	ablock	of	JSON	code.	For	more	complex	
configuration	objects,	you	can	click	[Toggle	JSON	Editor	]to	switch	between	text	fields	and	JSON	code	for	the	
configuration	data.	
To	create	anew	configuration	object:	
1.	From	the	Configurations	page	(	),	click	[Create	Configuration	].The	Create	Configuration	pane	
appears:	
TIP:	Instead	of	creating	acompletely	new	configuration	object,	you	can	also	edit	an	existing	
configuration	object	that	has	some	of	the	configuration	data	that	you	want	to	use	and	click	[Copy	
as	]from	the	Configuration	pane	to	create	acopy	of	that	configuration	object.

2.	Complete	the	following	fields:	
l	Friendly	Name	.Name	of	the	configuration	object	that	will	display	in	the	user	interface.	
l	Description	.A	brief	description	of	the	configuration	object.	
l	Author	.User	or	organization	that	created	the	configuration	object.	
l	Version	.Version	of	the	configuration	object.	
l	Configuration	Data	Values	.To	add	configuration	values	in	the	form	of	name-	value	pairs,	click	
[Add¬†Value	].¬†Complete	the	Name	and	Value	fields,	and	select	Encrypted	ifneeded.	
TIP:	Click	[Toggle	JSON	Editor	]to	view	the	JSON	configuration	data	for	the	configuration	
object	at	the	bottom	of	the	pane.	Click	[Toggle	JSON	Editor	]again	to	view	the	
Configuration	Data	Values	section	with	the	[Add	Value	]button	instead.	
123 

124	
3.	In	the	Configuration	Data	section,	include	the	required	block	of	code	to	ensure	that	the	applications	
aligned	to	this	configuration	object	do	not	fail:	
{	
""encrypted"":	false,	
""name"":	""sl1_	db_	host	"",	
""value"":	""${	config.sl1_	host	}""	
}	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	using	SL1	with	an	External	Database	(SL1	Extended	architecture	or	acloud-	based	
architecture),	update	the	""value""	of	that	block	of	code	to	be	the	host	of	your	database.	This	field	
accepts	IP	addresses.	For	example:	""value"":	""db.sciencelogic.com""	.Ifyou	are	not	using	the	
SL1	Extended	architecture	or	acloud-	based	architecture,	you	do	not	need	to	make	any	changes	to	
the	block	of	code	other	than	pasting	the	code	into	the	configuration	object.	
4.	Click	[Toggle	JSON	Editor	]to	view	the	JSON	configuration	data.	In	the	Configuration	Data	field,	update	
the	default	variable	definitions	to	match	your	PowerFlow	configuration.	For	example,	you	could	add	the	
following	JSON	code	to	the	Configuration	Data	field:	
[	
{	
""encrypted"":	false,	
""name"":	""sl1_	db_	host"",	
""value"":	""10.2.11.42""	
},
{	
""encrypted"":	false,	
""name"":	""em7_	user"",	
""value"":	""em7admin""	
},
{	
""encrypted"":	true,	
""name"":	""em7_	password"",	
""value"":	""+dqGJe1NwTyvdaO2EizTWjJ2uj2C1wzBzgNqVhpdTHA=""	
}	
]	
5.	When	creating	anew	configuration	variable,	note	the	syntax:	
l	The	configuration	file	is	surrounded	by	square	brackets.	
l	Each	variable	definition	is	surrounded	by	curly	braces.	
l	Each	key	name	is	surrounded	by	double-	quotes	and	followed	by	acolon,	while	each	value	is	
surrounded	by	double-	quotes	and	followed	by	acomma.	
l	Each	key:value	pair	in	the	definition	is	separated	with	acomma	after	the	closing	curly	brace.	The	last	
key:value	pair	should	not	include	acomma.

6.	To	create	aconfiguration	variable,	define	the	following	keys:	
l	encrypted	.Specifies	whether	the	value	will	appear	in	plain	text	or	encrypted	in	this	JSON	file.	Ifyou	
set	this	to	""true"",	when	the	value	is	uploaded,	PowerFlow	encrypts	the	value	of	the	variable.	The	plain	
text	value	cannot	be	retrieved	again	by	an	end	user.	The	encryption	key	is	unique	to	each	PowerFlow	
system	.The	value	is	followed	by	acomma.	
l	name	.Specifies	the	name	of	the	configuration	file,	without	the	JSON	suffix.	This	value	appears	in	the	
user	interface.	The	value	is	surrounded	by	double-	quotes	and	followed	by	acomma.	
l	value	.Specifies	the	value	to	assign	to	the	variable.	The	value	is	surrounded	by	double-	quotes	and	
followed	by	acomma.	
7.	Click	[Save	],or	click	[Copy	as	]to	save	the	configuration	object	as	anew	configuration	object	with	adifferent	
name.	
8.	Align	this	configuration	object	with	the	applications	that	you	want	to	run	by	clicking	the	Configure	button	
from	the	detail	page	for	each	application	and	selecting	this	configuration	object	from	the	Configuration	
drop-	down.	
NOTE	:In	astep,	you	can	include	the	config.	prefix	with	avariable	to	tell	the	PowerFlow	system	to	look	in	a	
configuration	object	to	resolve	the	variable.

Viewing	Logs	in	SL1	PowerFlow	
O v e r v i e w
This	chapter	describes	the	different	types	of	logging	available	in	PowerFlow	.	
This	chapter	covers	the	following	topics:	
Logging	Data	in	PowerFlow	128	
Logging	Configuration	129	
PowerFlow	Log	Files	129	
Working	with	Log	Files	130	
Viewing	the	Step	Logs	and	Step	Data	for	a	PowerFlow	Application	132	
Removing	Logs	on	a	Regular	Schedule	133
127 

128
L o g g i n g	D a ta	i n	P o w e r F l o w	
PowerFlow	allows	you	to	view	log	data	locally,	remotely,	or	through	Docker.	
L oc a l	L og g i n g	
PowerFlow	writes	logs	to	files	on	ahost	system	directory.	Each	of	the	main	components,	such	as	the	process	
manager	or	Celery	workers,	and	each	application	that	is	run	on	the	platform,	generates	alog	file.	The	application	
log	files	use	the	application	name	for	easy	consumption	and	location.	
In	aclustered	environment,	the	logs	must	be	written	to	the	same	volume	or	disk	being	used	for	persistent	storage.	
This	ensures	that	all	logs	are	gathered	from	all	hosts	in	the	cluster	onto	asingle	disk,	and	that	each	application	log	
can	contain	information	from	separately	located,	disparate	workers.	
You	can	also	implement	log	features	such	as	rolling,	standard	out,	level,	and	location	setting,	and	you	can	
configure	these	features	with	their	corresponding	environment	variable	or	setting	in	aconfiguration	file.	
NOTE:	Although	itis	possible	to	write	logs	to	file	on	the	host	for	persistent	debug	logging,	as	abest	practice,	
ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	utilize	alogging	driver	and	write	out	the	container	logs	
somewhere	else.	
TIP:	You	can	use	the	""Timed	Removal""	application	in	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	to	remove	logs	from	
Couchbase	on	aregular	schedule.	On	the	Configuration	pane	for	that	application,	specify	the	number	
of	days	before	the	next	log	removal.	
R e m ot e	L og g i n g	
Ifyou	use	your	own	existing	logging	server,	such	as	Syslog,	Splunk,	or	Logstash,	PowerFlow	can	route	its	logs	to	a	
customer-	specified	location.	To	do	so,	attach	your	service,	such	as	logspout,	to	the	microservice	stack	and	
configure	your	service	to	route	all	logs	to	the	server	of	your	choice.	
CAUTION:	Although	PowerFlow	supports	logging	to	these	remote	systems,	ScienceLogic	does	not	officially	
own	or	support	the	configuration	of	the	remote	logging	locations.	Use	the	logging	to	aremote	
system	feature	at	your	own	discretion.	
V i e w i n g	L og s	i n	D oc k e r	
You	can	use	the	Docker	command	line	to	view	the	logs	of	any	current	running	service	in	the	PowerFlow	cluster.	To	
view	the	logs	of	any	service,	run	the	following	command:	
docker	service	logs	-f	iservices_	<service_	name	>	
Logging	Data	in	PowerFlow 

Logging	Configuration	
Some	common	examples	include	the	following:	
docker	service	logs	‚Äìf	iservices_	couchbase	
docker	service	logs	‚Äìf	iservices_	steprunner	
docker	service	logs	‚Äìf	iservices_	contentapi	
NOTE:	Application	logs	are	stored	on	the	central	database	as	well	as	on	all	of	the	Docker	hosts	in	aclustered	
environment.	These	logs	are	stored	at	/var/log/iservices	for	both	single-	node	or	clustered	
environments.	However,	the	logs	on	each	Docker	host	only	relate	to	the	services	running	on	that	host.	
For	this	reason,	using	the	Docker	service	logs	is	the	best	way	to	get	logs	from	all	hosts	at	once.	
L o g g i n g	C o n f i g u r a ti o n	
The	following	table	describes	the	variables	and	configuration	settings	related	to	logging	in	PowerFlow	:	
Environment	Variable/Config	Setting	Description	Default	Setting	
logdir	The	directory	to	which	logs	will	
be	written.	
/var/log/iservices	
stdoutlog	Whether	logs	should	be	written	
to	standard	output	(stdout).	
True	
loglevel	Log	level	setting	for	PowerFlow	
application	modules.	
debug/info	(varies	between	
development	and	product	
environments)	
celery_	log_	level	The	log	level	for	Celery-	related	
components	and	modules.	
debug/info	(varies	between	
development	and	product	
environments)	
P o w e r F l o w	L o g	F i l e s	
In	PowerFlow	version	2.1.0	and	later,	additional	logging	options	were	added	for	gui	,api	,and	rabbitmq	services.	
The	logs	from	aservice	are	available	in	the	/var/log/iservices	directory	on	which	that	particular	service	is	
running.
To	aggregate	logs	for	the	entire	cluster,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	use	atool	like	Docker	
Syslog:¬†	https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/syslog/	.

By	default	all	nginx	logs	are	written	to	stdout.	Although	not	enabled	by	default,	you	can	also	choose	to	write	access	
and	error	logs	to	file	in	addition	to	stdout.	
To	log	to	apersistent	file,	simply	mount	afile	to	/host/directory:/var/log/nginx	,which	will	by	default	log	both	
access	and	error	logs.	
For	pypiserver	logs,	the	logs	are	not	persisted	to	disk	by	default.	You	can	choose	to	persist	pypiserver	logs	by	setting	
the	log_	to_	file	environment	variable	to	true.	
Ifyou	choose	to	persist	logs,	you	should	mount	ahost	volume	to	/var/log/devpi	to	access	logs	from	ahos.	For	
example:¬†	/var/log/iservices/devpi:/var/log/devpi	.	
L og s	f or	t h e	a p i	S e r v i c e	
By	default	all	log	messages	related	to	PowerFlow	are	written	out	to	/var/log/iservices/contentapi	.	
PowerFlow	-specific	logging	is	controlled	by	existing	settings	listed	in	Logging	Configuration	.Although	not	
enabled	by	default,	you	can	also	choose	to	write	nginx	access	and	error	logs	to	file	in	addition	to	stdout.	
To	log	to	apersistent	file,	simply	mount	afile	to	/file/location/host:/var/log/nginx/nginx_	error.log	or	
/host/directory:/var/log/nginx	depending	ifyou	want	access	or	error	logs.	
L og s	f or	t h e	r a b b i t m q	S e r v i c e	
Logs	for	the	rabbitmq	service	were	not	previously	persisted,	but	with	PowerFlow	2.1.0,	all	rabbitmq	service	logs	
are	written	to	stdout	by	default.	You	can	choose	write	to	alogfile	(stdout	or	logfile,	not	both).	
To	write	to	the	logfile:	
1.	Add	the	following	environment	variable	for	the	rabbitmq	service:	
RABBITMQ_	LOGS:	""/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit.log""	
2.	Mount	avolume:	/var/log/iservices/rabbit:/var/log/rabbitmq	
The	retention	policy	of	these	logs	is	10	MB,	for	atotal	of	five	maximum	logs	written	to	file.

Use	the	following	procedures	to	help	you	locate	and	understand	the	contents	of	the	various	log	files	related	to	
PowerFlow	.	
A c c e s s i n g	D oc k e r ¬†L og	F i l e s	
The	Docker	log	files	contain	information	logged	by	all	containers	participating	in	PowerFlow	.The	information	
below	is	also	available	in	the	PowerPacks	listed	above.	
Working	with	Log	Files 

Working	with	Log	Files	
To	access	Docker	log	files:	
1.	Use	SSH	to	connect	to	the	PowerFlow	instance.	
2.	Run	the	following	Docker	command:	
docker	service	ls	
3.	Note	the	Docker	service	name,	which	you	will	use	for	the	<service_	name>	value	in	the	next	step.	
4.	Run	the	following	Docker	command:	
docker	service	logs	-f	<service_	name>	
A c c e s s i n g	L oc a l	F i l e	S y s t e m	L og s	
The	local	file	system	logs	display	the	same	information	as	the	Docker	log	files.	These	log	files	include	debug	
information	for	all	of	the	PowerFlow	applications	and	all	of	the	Celery	worker	nodes.	
To	access	local	file	system	logs:	
1.	Use	SSH	to	connect	to	the	PowerFlow	instance.	
2.	Navigate	to	the	/var/log/iservices	directory	to	view	the	log	files.	
U n d e r s t a n d i n g	t h e	C on t e n t s	of	L og	F i l e s	
The	pattern	of	deciphering	log	messages	applies	to	both	Docker	logs	and	local	log	files,	as	these	logs	display	the	
same	information.	
The	following	is	an	example	of	amessage	in	aDocker	log	or	alocal	file	system	log:	
""2018-	11-	05	19:02:28,312"",""FLOW"",""12"",""device_	sync_	sciencelogic_	to_	servicenow"",""ipaas_	
logger"",""142"",""stop	Query	and	Cache	ServiceNow	CIs|41.4114570618""	
You	can	parse	this	data	in	the	following	manner:	
'YYYY-	MM-	DD'	'HH-	MM-	SS,ss'	'log-	level'	'process_	id'	'is_	app_	name'	'file'	'lineOfCode'	
'message'
To	extract	the	runtime	for	each	individual	task,	use	regex	to	match	on	alog	line.	For	instance,	in	the	above	
example,	there	is	the	following	sub-	string:	
""stop	Query	and	Cache	ServiceNow	CIs|41.4114570618""	
Use	regex	to	parse	the	string	above:	
""stop	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	|	‚Ä¶""	
where:	
l	Everything	after	the	|is	the	time	taken	for	execution.	
l	The	string	between	""stop""	and	|represents	the	step	that	was	executed.	
In	the	example	message,	the	""Query	and	Cache	ServiceNow	CIs""	step	took	around	41	seconds	to	run.

Using	the	pfctl	Command-	line	Utility	
O v e r v i e w
This	chapter	describes	how	to	use	the	pfctl	command-	line	utility	to	run	automatic	cluster	healthcheck	and	
autoheal	actions	that	will	verify	the	configuration	of	your	PowerFlow	cluster	or	asingle	PowerFlow	node.	The	pfctl	
utility	also	includes	an	autocluster	action	that	performs	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	on	either	the	node	or	
the	cluster.	You	can	use	this	action	to	automate	the	configuration	of	athree-	node	cluster.	
NOTE:	The	pfctl	command-	line	utility	was	called	iservicecontrol	in	previous	release	of	SL1	PowerFlow	.You	
can	use	either	""iservicecontrol""	or	""pfctl""	in	commands,	but	""iservicecontrol""	will	eventually	be	
deprecated	in	favor	of	""pfctl"".	
NOTE:	The	different	actions	available	with	the	pfctl	utility	should	replace	the	need	to	configure	and	run	the	
different	PowerPacks	described	in	Using	SL1	to	Monitor	PowerFlow	.

The	pfctl	command-	line	utility	included	in	PowerFlow	contains	automatic	cluster	healthcheck	and	autoheal	
actions	that	will	verify	the	configuration	of	your	cluster	or	single	node.¬†The	utility	also	includes	an	autocluster	
action	that	performs	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	on	either	the	node	or	the	cluster.	
The	pfctl	utility	is	included	in	PowerFlow	version	2.0.0	or	later.	Ifyou	are	using	an	older	version	of	PowerFlow	,	
contact¬†	ScienceLogic	Support	for	the	latest	version	of	the	utility.	
NOTE:	You	can	use	key-	based	authentication	instead	of	username	and	password	authentication	for	the	pfctl	
command-	line	utility.	
For	alist	of	all	of	the	actions	you	can	run	on	asingle	node,	SSH	to	the	PowerFlow	server	and	run	the	following	
command:	
pfctl	node-	action	--help	
For	alist	of	all	of	the	actions	you	can	run	on	aclustered	system,	run	the	following	command:	
pfctl	cluster-	action	--help

The	pfctl	command-	line	utility	performs	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	in	aclustered	PowerFlow	
environment.	The	pfctl	utility	contains	automatic	cluster	healthcheck	and	autoheal	capabilities	that	you	can	use	
to	prevent	issues	with	your	PowerFlow	environment:	
l	The¬†	healthcheck	¬†action	executes	various	commands¬†to	verify	configurations,	proxies,	internal	connectivity,	
queue	cluster,	database	cluster,	indexes,	NTP	settings,	Docker	versions	on	all	clusters,	and	more.¬†Any	
previously	reported	troubleshooting	issues	are	addressed	with	the	healthcheck	action.	
l	The¬†	autoheal	¬†action	automatically	takes	corrective	action	on	your	cluster.	
After	deploying	any	clusters¬†in	aPowerFlow	system,	or	ifyou	are	troubleshooting	an	existing	cluster,	you	should	first	
run¬†the	healthcheck	¬†action	to	generate	immediate	diagnostics	of	the	entire	cluster	and	all	services	and	containers	
associated	with	the	cluster.	Ifthe	healthcheck	¬†action	finds	any	issues,	you	can	run	the	autoheal	action	to	attempt	
to	address	those	issues.

You	can	also	validate	the	docker-	compose	file	with	the	pfctl	healthcheck	action.	The	action	will	show	a	
message	ifpypiserver	or	dexserver	services	are	not	configured	properly	in	the	docker-	compose	file.	You	can	fix

The	healthcheck	action	in	the	pfctl	command-	line	utility	for	PowerFlow	clusters	will	check	the	Docker	version	
for	each	cluster	to	ensure	that	the	Docker	version	is	the	same	in	all	the	hosts.

You	can	use	the	pfctl	command-	line	utility	to	perform	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	on	your¬†	PowerFlow	
cluster.	You	can	use	the	autocluster	action	with	the	pfctl	command	to	automate	the	configuration	of	athree-	node	
cluster.
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	using	another	cluster	configuration,	the	deployment	process	should	be	manual,	because	the	
pfctl	utility	only	supports	the	automated	configuration	of	athree-	node	cluster.	
WARNING:	The	autocluster	action	will	completely	reset	and	remove	all	data	from	the	system.	When	you	run	
this	action,	you	will	get	aprompt	verifying	that	you	want	run	the	action	and	delete	all	data.	
To	automate	the	configuration	of	athree-	node	cluster,	run	the	following	command:	
pfctl	--host	<is_	host1>	<username>	:<password>	--host	<is_	host2>	
<username>	:<password>	--host	<is_	host3>	<username>	:<password>	autocluster	
For	example:	
pfctl	--host	192.11.1.1	isadmin:passw0rd	--host	192.11.1.2	isadmin:passw0rd	--host	
192.11.1.3	isadmin:passw0rd	autocluster	
153 

154
Running	this	command	will	configure	your	PowerFlow	three-	node	cluster	without	any	additional	manual	steps	
required.
WARNING:	Ifthe	isadmin	(host)	password	contains	aspecial	character,	such	as	an	""@""	or	""#""	symbol,	the	
password	must	be	escaped	in	the	iservicecontrol	autocluster	command	by	adding	single	
quotes,	such	as	'user:password'	.For	example:	iservicecontrol	--host	10.10.10.100	
'isadmin:testing@is'	--host	10.10.10.102	'isadmin:testing@is'	--host	
10.10.10.105	'isadmin:testing@is'	autocluster

This	topic	explains	how	to	use	the	upgrade	action	in	the	pfctl	utility	to	upgrade	aclustered	environment	from	
PowerFlow	version	1.8.x	to	2.1.0.	The	upgrade	action	is	only	for	upgrading	acluster	from	a1.8.x	installation,	
and	should	not	be	run	otherwise.	
NOTE:	The	pfctl	utility	cannot	be	installed	on	a1.8.4	PowerFlow	system	because	the	utility	is	not	compatible	
with	Python	2.7.¬†If	you	want	to	use	the	utility	on	a1.8.4	PowerFlow	system,	you	will	need	to	run	the	
is_	upgrade_	to_	v2.sh	on	any	of	the	cluster	nodes.	This	script	will	update	the	nodes	to	Python	3.x,	
and	then	you	can	download	and	install	the	pfctl	utility	on	the	upgraded	node,	and	upgrade	of	the	
other	nodes	from	that	node.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	have	an	environment	that	has	Python	3.6	or	later	available,	the	pfctl	package	can	be	installed	
in	that	system	(a	local	environment,	virtual	machine,	or	another	PowerFlow	system).	That	
environment	must	have	an¬†SSH	connection	to	the	PowerFlow	nodes	that	you	want	to	upgrade.¬†Also,	
be	aware	that	only	certain	actions,	like	the	upgrade	action,	can	be	run	from	an	external	system,	but	
most	of	the	actions	that	the	pfctl	use	will	only	run	inside	the	cluster	nodes.	
To	run	the	upgrade	action	in	aclustered	environment:	
upgrade 

open_	firewall_	ports	
1.	Back	up	your	PowerFlow	data.	For	more	information,	see	Backing	up	Data	.	
2.	Run	the	upgrade	action	with	the	pfctl	utility:	
NOTE:	You	will	need	to	know	ifthe	upgrade	process	will	be	done	offline	or	online,	and	you	will	need	
the	url	of	the	PowerFlow	RPM	file	or	the	local	path	of	the	PowerFlow	RPM	or	ISO	file.	
For	an	offline	upgrade,	run	the	following	command	on	the	PowerFlow	instance:	
pfctl	--host	<swarm-	node1-	ip>	<is-	username>	:<is-	password>	--host	<swarm-	node2-	ip>	
<is-	username>	:<is-	password>	node-	action	--action	upgrade	--upgrade_	args	offline	
<PowerFlow-	iso-	local-	path>	
where	<PowerFlow-	iso-	local-	path>	is	alocal	path	such	as	/home/isadmin/sl1-	powerflow-	
2.2.0.iso	.	
For	an	online	upgrade,	run	the	following	command	on	the	PowerFlow	instance:	
pfctl	--host	<swarm-	node1-	ip>	<is-	username>:<is-	password>	--host	<swarm-	node2-	ip>	
<is-	username>	:<is-	password>	node-	action	--action	upgrade	--upgrade_	args	online	
<PowerFlow-	rpm-	url-	or-	local-	path>	
3.	Manually	open	the	firewall	ports	you	need,	or	use	the	pfctl	open-	firewall-	ports	action.	
4.	Synchronize	NTP	in	all	the	nodes.	For	more	information,	see	Preparing	the	PowerFlow	System	for	High	
Availability	.	
5.	Manually	verify	that	NTP	is	synchronized	in	all	the	nodes	manually,	or	use	the	pfctl	node	action	to	verify	that.	
6.	To	deploy	PowerFlow	,run	the	autocluster	action	using	the	pfctl	utility	ifyour	clustered	environment	contains	
three	nodes.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	using	another	cluster	configuration,	the	deployment	process	should	be	manual,	
because	the	pfctl	utility	only	supports	the	automated	configuration	of	athree-	node	cluster.	
7.	Run	the	healthcheck	cluster	action	using	the	pfctl	utility	to	check	that	the	cluster	environment	was	deployed	
correctly.	
8.	Run	the	autoheal	cluster	action	using	the	pfctl	utility	to	fix	any	errors	found	during	the	healthcheck	action	
run.	You	should	only	run	the	autoheal	action	ifthe	healthcheck	action	found	errors.	
o p e n _	f i r e w a l l _	p o r ts	
To	open	firewall	ports	for	asingle	node,	SSH	to	the	PowerFlow	server	and	run	the	following	command:	
pfctl	--host	<is_	host>	isadmin:	<password>	node-	action	--action	open_	firewall_	ports	
155 

156	
TIP:	Many	of	the	other	pfctl	actions	use	the	same	format	as	the	open_	firewall_	ports	action,	above.	The	only	
change	you	need	to	make	for	those	commands	is	to	replace	the	name	of	the	action	at	the	end	of	the	
command.	For	example:	pfctl	--host	<is_	host>	isadmin:<password>	node-	action	--	
action	pull_	latest_	images	
open_	firewall_	ports

Initial	Troubleshooting	Steps	
I n i ti a l	T r o u b l e s h o o ti n g	S te p s	
PowerFlow	acts	as	amiddle	server	between	data	platforms.	For	this	reason,	the	first	steps	should	always	be	to	
ensure	that	there	are	no	issues	with	the	data	platforms	with	which	PowerFlow	is	talking.	There	might	be	additional	
configurations	or	actions	enabled	on	ServiceNow	or	SL1	that	result	in	unexpected	behavior.	For	detailed	
information	about	how	to	perform	the	steps	below,	see	Resources	for	Troubleshooting	.	
S L 1	P ow e r F l ow	
1.	Run	docker	service	ls	on	the	PowerFlow	server.	
2.	Note	the	Docker	container	version,	and	verify	that	the	Docker	services	are	running.	
3.	Ifacertain	service	is	failing,	make	anote	the	service	name	and	version.	
4.	Ifacertain	service	is	failing,	run	docker	service	ps	<service_	name>	to	see	the	historical	state	of	the	
service	and	make	anote	of	this	information.	For	example:	docker	service	ps	iservices_	contentapi	.	
5.	Make	anote	of	any	logs	impacting	the	service	by	running	docker	service	logs	<service_	name>	.For	
example:	docker	service	logs	iservices_	couchbase	.	
S e r v i c e N ow	
1.	Make	anote	of	the	ServiceNow	version	and	Synchronization	PowerPack	version,	ifapplicable.	
2.	Make	anote	of	whether	the	user	is	running	an	update	set	or	aversion	of	the	Certified/Scoped	application,	if	
relevant.	
3.	Make	anote	of	the	ServiceNow	application	that	is	failing	on	PowerFlow	.	
4.	Make	anote	of	what	step	is	failing	in	the	application,	try	running	the	application	in	debug	mode,	and	capture	
any	traceback	or	error	messages	that	occur	in	the	step	log.

The	PowerFlow	includes	acommand-	line	utility	called	pfctl	that	performs	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	in	a	
clustered	PowerFlow	environment.	The	pfctl	utility	contains	automatic	cluster	healthcheck	and	autoheal	
capabilities	that	you	can	use	to	prevent	issues	with	your	PowerFlow	environment.	
For	more	information,	see	Using	the	pfctl	Command-	line	Utility	.

PowerFlow	is	aset	of	services	that	are	containerized	using	Docker.	For	more	information	about	Docker,	see	the	
Docker	tutorial	.	
Use	the	following	Docker	commands	for	troubleshooting	and	diagnosing	issues	with	PowerFlow	:	
V i e w i n g	C o n t a i n e r	V e r s i o n s	a n d	S t a t u s	
To	view	the	PowerFlow	version,	SSH	to	your	PowerFlow	instance	and	run	the	following	command:	
docker	service	ls	
In	the	results,	you	can	see	the	container	ID,	name,	mode,	status	(see	the	replicas	column),	and	version	(see	the	
image	column)	for	all	the	services	that	make	up	PowerFlow	:

You	can	use	the	Docker	command	line	to	view	the	logs	of	any	current	running	service	in	the	PowerFlow	cluster.	To	
view	the	logs	of	any	service,	run	the	following	command:	
docker	service	logs	-f	iservices_	<service_	name	>	
Some	common	examples	include	the	following:	
docker	service	logs	‚Äìf	iservices_	couchbase	
docker	service	logs	‚Äìf	iservices_	steprunner	
docker	service	logs	‚Äìf	iservices_	contentapi	
NOTE:	Application	logs	are	stored	on	the	central	database	as	well	as	on	all	of	the	Docker	hosts	in	aclustered	
environment.	These	logs	are	stored	at	/var/log/iservices	for	both	single-	node	or	clustered	
environments.	However,	the	logs	on	each	Docker	host	only	relate	to	the	services	running	on	that	host.	
For	this	reason,	using	the	Docker	service	logs	is	the	best	way	to	get	logs	from	all	hosts	at	once.

RabbitMQ	is	aservice	that	distributes	tasks	to	be	executed	by	PowerFlow	workers.	This	section	covers	how	to	
handle	potential	issues	with	RabbitMQ.	
The	following	error	message	might	appear	ifyou	try	to	run	aPowerFlow	application	via	the	API:	
Internal	error	occurred:	Traceback	(most	recent	call	last):\n	File	\"./content_

First,	verify	that	your	services	are	up.	Ifthere	is	an	issue	with	your	RabbitMQ	volume,	you	can	clear	the	volume	with	
the	following	commands:	
docker	service	rm	iservices_	rabbitmq	
docker	volume	rm	iservices_	rabbitdb	
Ifyou	get	amessage	stating	that	the	volume	is	in	use,	run	the	following	command:

NOTE:	Restarting	Docker	does	not	clear	the	queue,	because	the	queue	is	persistent.	However,	clearing	the	
queue	with	the	commands	above	might	result	in	data	loss	due	to	the	tasks	being	removed	from	the	
queue.

You	can	determine	how	an	SL1	device	links	to	aServiceNow	CI	record	by	using	the	respective	device	and	sys	IDs.	
You	can	retrieve	these	IDs	from	the	PowerFlow	Couchbase	service.	
First,	locate	the	correlation	ID	with	the	following	Couchbase	query:	
select	meta	().id	from	logs	where	meta	().id	like	""lookup%""	
This	query	returns	results	similar	to	the	following:

Ifyou	don't	have	access	to	port	8091	on	your	PowerFlow	instance,	you	can	connect	to	the	Couchbase	container	by	
using	the	command-	line	interface	(CLI).	
To	access	Couchbase	by	using	the	CLI,	run	the	following	commands:

You	can	use	the	API	or	cURL	to	retrieve	the	application	code,	which	is	useful	when	you	are	troubleshooting	
potential	code-	related	issues.	You	cannot	access	these	API	endpoints	with	abrowser,	but	you	can	request	these	
API	endpoints	by	using	an	application	such	as	Postman:	
https://<	PowerFlow	>/api/v1/applications/<	application_	name	>	
Ifyou	do	not	have	access	to	Postman,	you	can	use	cURL	to	get	the	same	information.

You	can	define	and	retrieve	schedules	using	the	PowerFlow	API.	You	can	define	all	of	these	schedules	in	the	
PowerFlow	user	interface	as	well.	
To	create	aschedule	via	the	API,	POST	the	following	payload	to	the	API	endpoint:	
https://<	PowerFlow	>/api/v1/schedule	
{

Multiple	diagnosis	tools	exist	to	assist	in	troubleshooting	issues	with	the	PowerFlow	platform:	
l	Docker	PowerPack	.This	PowerPack	monitors	your	Linux-	based¬†	PowerFlow	server	with	SSH¬†	(the	PowerFlow	
ISO	is	built	on	top	of	an	Oracle	Linux	Operating	System).	This	PowerPack	provides	key	performance	
indicators	about	how	your	PowerFlow	server	is	performing.	For	more	information	on	the	Docker	PowerPack	
and	other	PowerPacks	that	you	can	use	to	monitor	PowerFlow	,see	the	""Using	SL1	to	Monitor	SL1	
PowerFlow	""chapter	in	the	SL1	PowerFlow	Platform	manual	.	
l	Flower.	This	web	interface	tool	can	be	found	at	the	/flower	endpoint.	Itprovides	adashboard	displaying	the	
number	of	tasks	in	various	states	as	well	as	an	overview	of	the	state	of	each	worker.	This	tool	shows	the	
current	number	of	active,	processed,	failed,	succeeded,	and	retried	tasks	on	the	PowerFlow	platform.	This	
tool	also	shows	detailed	information	about	each	of	the	tasks	that	have	been	executed	on	the	platform.	This	
data	includes	the	UUID,	the	state,	the	arguments	that	were	passed	to	it,	as	well	as	the	worker	and	the	time	of	
execution.	Flower	also	provides	aperformance	chart	that	shows	the	number	of	tasks	running	on	each	
individual	worker.	
l	Debug	Mode	.All	applications	can	be	run	in	""debug""	mode	via	the	PowerFlow	API.	Running	applications	in	
debug	mode	may	slow	down	the	platform,	but	they	will	result	in	much	more	detailed	logging	information	that	
is	helpful	for	troubleshooting	issues.	For	more	information	on	running	applications	in	Debug	Mode,	see	
Retrieving	Additional	Debug	Information	.	
l	Application	Logs	.All	applications	generate	alog	file	specific	to	that	application.	These	log	files	can	be	found	
at	/var/log/iservices	and	each	log	file	will	match	the	ID	of	the	application.	These	log	files	combine	all	the	log	
messages	of	all	previous	runs	of	an	application	up	to	acertain	point.	These	log	files	roll	over	and	will	get	
auto-	cleared	after	acertain	point.

Identifying	Why	a	Service	or	Container	Failed	
l	Step	Logs	.Step	logs	display	the	log	output	for	aspecific	step	in	the	application.	These	step	logs	can	be	
accessed	via	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	by	clicking	on	astep	in	an	application	and	bringing	up	the	Step	
Log	tab.	These	step	logs	display	just	the	log	output	for	the	latest	run	of	that	step.	
l	Service	Logs	.Each	Docker	service	has	its	own	log.	These	can	be	accessed	via	SSH	by	running	the	following	
command:	
docker	service	logs	-f	<service_	name>	
I d e n ti f y i n g	W h y	a	S e r v i c e	o r	C o n ta i n e r	F a i l e d	
This	section	outlines	the	troubleshooting	steps	necessary	to	determine	the	underlying	root	cause	of	why	aservice	or	
container	was	restarted.	For	this	section,	we	use	the	iservices_	redis	service	as	an	example.	
S t e p	1 :	O b t a i n	t h e	I D	of	t h e	f a i l e d	c on t a i n e r	f or	t h e	s e r v i c e	
Run	the	following	command	for	the	service	that	failed	previously:	
docker	service	ps	--no-	trunc	<servicename>	
For	example:	
docker	service	ps	--no-	trunc	iservices_	redis	
From	the	command	result	above,	we	see	that	one	container	with	the	id	3s7s86n45skf	had	failed	previously	while	
running	on	node	is-	scale-	03	,with	the	error	""non-	zero	exit"",	and	another	container	was	restarted	in	its	place.	
At	this	point,	we	can	ask	the	following	questions:	
l	When	you	run	docker	service	ps	--no-	trunc	,is	the	error	something	obvious?	Does	the	error	say	that	it	
cannot	mount	avolume,	or	that	the	image	is	not	found?	Ifso,	that's	most	likely	the	root	cause	of	the	issue	and	
what	needs	to	be	addressed	
l	Did	the	node	on	which	that	container	was	running	go	down?	Or	is	that	node	still	up?	
l	Are	the	other	services	running	on	that	node	running	fine?¬†Was	only	this	single	service	affected?	
l	Ifother	services	are	running	fine	on	that	same	node,	itis	probably	aproblem	with	the	service	itself.	Ifall	
services	on	that	node	are	not	functional,	itcould	mean	anode	failure.	
At	this	point,	we	should	be	confident	that	the	cause	of	the	issue	is	not	adeploy	configuration	issue,	itis	not	an	entire	
node	failure,	and	the	problem	exists	within	the	service	itself.	Continue	to	Step	2	ifthis	is	the	case.	
S t e p	2 :	C h e c k	f or	a n y	e r r or	m e s s a g e s	or	l og s	i n d i c a t i n g	a n	e r r or	
Using	the	id	obtained	from	step	1	we	can	collect	the	logs	from	the	failed	container	with	the	following	commands:	
docker	service	logs	<failed-	id>	
165 

166
For	example:	
docker	service	logs	3s7s86n45skf	
Search	the	service	logs	for	any	explicit	errors	or	warning	messages	that	might	indicate	why	the	failure	occurred.	
Usually,	you	can	find	the	error	message	in	those	logs,	but	ifthe	container	ran	out	of	memory,	itmay	not	be	seen	
here.	Continue	to	Step	3	ifthe	logs	provide	nothing	fruitful.	
S t e p	3 :	C h e c k	f or	ou t	of	m e m or y	e v e n t s	
Ifthere	were	no	errors	in	the	logs,	or	anywhere	else	that	can	be	seen,	apossible	cause	for	acontainer	restart	could	
be	that	the	system	ran	out	of	memory.	
Perform	the	following	steps	to	identify	ifthis	is	the	case:	
1.	Log	in	to	the	node	where	the	container	failed	in	our	example.¬†As	seen	in	step	1,	the	container	failed	on	is-	
scale-	03	.	
2.	From	the	node	where	the	container	failed,	run	the	following	command:	
journalctl	-k	|	grep	-i	-e	memory	-e	oom	
3.	Check	the	result	for	any	out	of	memory	events	that	caused	the	container	to	stop.	Such	an	event	typically	looks	
like	the	following:
is-	scale-	03	kernel:	Out	of	memory:	Kill	process	5946	(redis-	server)	score	575	
or	sacrifice	child	
T r ou b l e s h oot i n g	a	C l ou d	D e p l oy m e n t	of	P ow e r F l ow	
After	completing	the	AWS	setup	instructions,	ifnone	of	the	services	start	and	you	see	the	following	error	during	
troubleshooting,	the	problem	is	that	you	need	to	restart	Docker	after	installing	the	RPM	installation.

o	False	.disabled	the	environment	variable.	
o	Default	value	is	""False""	
NOTE	:Because	many	applications	run	at	regular	intervals	or	are	scheduled,	the	PowerFlow	system	re-	
executes	tasks	even	ifthe	task_	acks_	late	environment	variable	is	disabled.	in	the	event	of	aworker	
crash,	ifyou	want	to	ensure	that	tasks	are	completed,	you	can	enable	the	task_	acks_	late	variable.	
However,	be	aware	that	iftasks	are	not	idempotent,	the	task_	acks_	late	variable	can	cause	
unpredictable	results.	
To	define	these	environment	variables:	
1.	Either	go	to	the	console	of	the	PowerFlow	system	or	use	SSH	to	access	the	server.	
2.	Log	in	as	isadmin	with	the	appropriate	password.	
3.	Use	atext	editor	like	vi	to	edit	the	file	/opt/iservices/scripts/docker-	compose.yml	.	
4.	You	can	define	the	environment	variables	for	one	or	more	worker	processes.	The	docker-	compose.yml	file	
contains	definitions	for	worker	processes.	For	example,	you	might	see	something	like	this:

This	error	occurs	when	there	is	too	much	load	going	into	the	Couchbase	database.	Ifyou're	running	with	Debug	
Mode,	that	mode	creates	alarge	number	of	extra	log	messages	in	the	database,	which	can	contributeto	this	error.	
To	work	around	this	issue,	increase	the	timeout	being	used	by	setting	the	db_	host	environment	variable	in	the	
steprunner	service:	
db_	host:	'couchbase.isnet,localhost?n1ql_	timeout=100000000.00'	
Ifyou	increase	the	timeout,	the	timeout	errors	should	go	away.	
173 

174	
NOTE:	Increasing	the	timeout	might	not	always	be	the	correct	action.	Ifyou	are	using	an	especially	large	
system,	you	might	want	to	allocate	additional	resources	to	the	Couchbase	services,	including	more	
memory	for	indexing	and	search.	Ifyou	are	encountering	timeouts	in	anon-	temporary	fashion,	such	
as	only	running	Debug	Mode	for	an	applicationto	determine	what	went	wrong,	you	might	want	to	add	
more	resources	instead	of	increasing	the	timeout.

A	deadlocked	state	occurs	when	one	or	more	applications	include	steps	that	are	either	ordered	improperly	or	that	
contain	syntax	errors.	In	this	situation,	tasks	are	waiting	on	subsequent	tasks	to	finish	executing,	but	the	worker	pool	
is	exhausted.	As	aresult,	PowerFlow	is	not	able	to	execute	those	subsequent	tasks.	
To	identify	adeadlocked	state	with	aPowerFlow	system	:	
1.	Navigate	to	the	Celery	Flower	interface	for	PowerFlow	by	typing	the	URL	or	IP	address	for	your¬†	PowerFlow

The	swarm	cluster	should	have	the	same	amount	of	nodes	and	node	labels	applied	as	in	the	previous	system	to	
ensure	identically	matching	Docker	environments.	All	nodes	in	the	cluster	must	have	the	PowerFlow	images	in	
your	docker-	compose.yml	file	loaded	and	available	(use	[docker	image	ls]).	
After	the	PowerFlow	system	is	started,	you	can	run	the	""PowerFlow	Restore""	application	to	restore	all	previously	
used	applications,	cache,	and	config	data.	For	more	information,	see	Backing	up	Data	.	
NOTE:	Ifthe	workers/api	are	now	running	on	completely	new	nodes	after	the	restore,	you	will	have	to	re-

When	triggering	PowerFlow	application	from	the	applications/run	endpoint,	you	can	query	for	the	state	of	that	
application	in	two	ways:	
1.	Asynchronously	.When	you	POST	arun	of	aPowerFlow	application	to	/applications/run	,the	response	is	
an	integration	status	with	aTask	ID,	such	as:	isap-	23233-	df2f24-	etc	.At	any	time,	you	can	query	for	the	
current	state	of	that	task	from	the	endpoint	/api/v1/tasks/isap-	23233-	df2f24-	etc	.The	response	includes	
all	of	the	steps	run	by	the	application,	along	with	the	status	of	the	steps,	and	URL	links	to	additional	info,	such	
as	logs	for	each	step.	
2.	Synchronously	.When	you	POST	arun	of	an	application,	you	can	tell	PowerFlow	to	wait	responding	until	
the	application	is	complete	by	adding	the	wait	argument.	For	example,	
/api/v1/applications/run?wait=20	will	wait	for	20	seconds	before	responding.	The	maximum	wait	time	
is	30	seconds.	When	the	application	completes,	or	30	seconds	has	passed,	the	API	returns	the	current	status	
of	the	integration	run.	This	process	works	the	same	as	ifyou	had	manually	queried	/api/v1/tasks/isapp-	
w2ef2f2f	.Please	note	that	while	the	API	is	waiting	for	your	application	to	complete,	you	are	holding	on	to	a	
thread.	Ifyou	have	multiple	applications	that	run	for	along	period	of	time,	do	not	use	asynchronous	query	
unless	you	have	no	other	option.	ScienceLogic	recommends	using	an	asynchronous	query	whenever	
possible.

The	following	table	contains	aset	of	ratings	that	depict	the	level	of	resiliency	enabled	by	various	PowerFlow	
deployment	types.	The	higher	the	rating,	the	more	resilient	the	PowerFlow	system,	not	just	from	anode	failure	
perspective,	but	also	from	athroughput	and	load-	balancing	regard.

have	very	CPU-	or	memory-	intensive	tasks	executing	on	the	workers,	
and	want	to	completely	mitigate	risks	of	resource	contention	between	
services.	
You	can	start	with	any	deployment	type,	and	at	alater	time	scale	up	to	any	other	deployment	type	as	needed.	For	
example,	ayou	can	start	with	asingle-	node	deployment,	then	at	alater	date	add	three	more	nodes	to	enable	a	
3+	node	cluster	with	separate	workers.	
The	deployments	listed	in	the	table	are	just	the	standards	for	deployment.	For	very	high-	scale	customers,	amore	
advanced	deployment	might	be	necessary.	For	deployment	requirements	like	this,	please	contact	ScienceLogic	
Support.
WARNING:	Ifyou	are	deploying	PowerFlow	without	aload	balancer,	you	can	only	use	the	deployed	IP	
address	as	the	management	user	interface.	Ifyou	use	another	node	to	log	in	to	the	PowerFlow

The	following	High	Availability	deployment	is	an	example	of	athree-	node	cluster:	
l	Each	node	in	the	Swarm	is	aSwarm	Manager.	
l	All	Swarm	nodes	are	located	within	the	same	data	center.	
The	three-	node	cluster	is	the	most	basic	option	providing	full	High	Availability	and	data	replication	support	among	
three	nodes.	In	this	deployment,	each	of	the	three	nodes	are	running	the	same	services	in	aclustered	
environment,	which	provides	failover	and	data	loss	prevention	capabilities.	This	deployment	option	will	satisfy	most	
High	Availability	needs,	but	itdoes	not	mitigate	risks	with	the	potential	for	worker	operations	to	affect	and	degrade	
the	database	and	queue	services,	because	all	services	are	running	on	the	same	nodes.	
This	deployment	provides:	
l	Automatic	failover	for	one	out	of	three	node	failure	:Ifone	node	in	the	cluster	fails,	automatic	failover	
occurs,	and	the	PowerFlow	system	will	continue	to	be	operational	running	on	two	out	of	three	of	the	nodes.	
l	Full	data	replication	between	all	three	nodes	.All	nodes	have	acopy	of	the	same	data	replicated	across	
all	three	nodes.	Ifone	or	two	nodes	fail,	you	will	not	experience	data	loss	in	the	database	or	in	the	queues.	
l	Full	queue	mirroring	between	all	three	nodes	.All	nodes	have	amirror	of	the	queues	defined	in	the	
PowerFlow	environment.	Ifone	or	two	nodes	fail,	the	system	still	retains	messages	in	queues	using	the	
autoheal	policy	by	default.	For	more	information	about	autoheal	behavior	in	RabbitMQ,	see	The	RabbitMQ

When	only	three	nodes	are	allocated	used	for	High	Availability,	the	following	risks	are	present:	
l	Over-	utilization	of	nodes	causing	clustering	issues	.In	athree	node	cluster,	worker	containers,	and	
Docker	Swarm	Managers	are	running	on	the	same	node	as	the	database	and	queue	services.	As	aresult,	if	
the	node	is	not	provisioned	correctly,	there	could	be	some	resource	contention.	Ifanode	reaches	100%	
CPU,	Docker	Swarm	cluster	operations	might	fail,	causing	anode	to	completely	restart,	and	causing	a	
failover	or	other	unexpected	behavior.	
l	Over-	utilization	of	workers	nodes	causing	database	or	queue	issues	.Since	all	services	are	sharing	
the	same	nodes	in	this	configuration,	ifworker	operations	become	extremely	CPU-	or	memory-	intensive,	the	
system	might	try	to	use	resources	needed	from	the	database	or	queue.	Ifthis	happens,	you	might	encounter	
failures	when	querying	the	database	or	using	the	queues.	
M i t i g a t i n g	R i s k s	
The	above	risks	can	be	mitigated	by	ensuring	that	the	node	is	deployed	with	adequate	CPU	and	memory	for	the	
workloads	that	you	plan	to	run	on	the	node.	Memory	limits	are	placed	on	containers	by	default.	Ifneeded,	you	
could	also	add	CPU	limits	to	worker	containers	to	further	prevent	resource	contention.

The	three-	node	cluster	with	separate	workers	is	aslight	variation	of	the	standard	three-	node	cluster.	With	this	
deployment	strategy,	all	worker	operation	load	is	run	by	aseparate	independent	node.	This	is	preferable	over	the	
standard	three-	node	deployment,	because	itcompletely	prevents	worker	operations	from	stealing	resources	from	
the	databases	or	queues.	
Since	steprunner	workload	is	entirely	on	dedicated	servers,	you	have	greater	ability	to	scale	up	to	more	workers,	or	
even	add	additional	nodes	of	workers	to	the	system,	without	affecting	critical	database	or	queue	operations.	
This	deployment	provides	acomplete	separation	of	worker	processing	from	the	database	and	queue	processing,	
which	is	very	helpful	for	users	which	have	very	CPU-	intensive	tasks	that	execute	frequently.	
The	following	High	Availability	deployment	adds	Docker	Swarm	worker	nodes	where	steprunners	can	be	
constrained.	This	lets	you	continue	to	scale	out	new	worker	nodes	as	the	load	increases.	This	also	lets	you	distribute	
steprunners	based	on	workloads.	Core	services	include	ContentAPI,	RabbitMQ,	and	Couchbase.	
You	can	add	drained	Docker	Swarm	Manager	nodes	to	increase	fault	tolerance	of	the	Swarm,	and	to	ensure	that	
the	orchestration	of	the	Swarm	is	not	impeded	by	large	workloads	on	the	core	nodes.	
The	maximum	Couchbase	cluster	with	fully	replicated	nodes	is	four.	Anything	greater	than	four	will	not	have	afull	
replica	set	and	will	auto-	shard	data	across	additional	nodes.	There	is	no	way	as	of	this	version	of	Couchbase	to	set	
the	placement	of	the	replicas.	Redis	replication	and	clustering	is	not	currently	supported	in	this	version	of	
PowerFlow	.

Core	Node	over-	utilization	could	cause	Swarm	clustering	problems.	Because	the	Swarms	are	the	same	
nodes	as	the	core	managers,	there	is	apossibility	for	heavily	loaded	databases	and	queues	to	contend	with	the	
Swarm	hosts	for	resources.	In	this	case	the	Swarm	may	restart	itself	and	the	services	running	on	that	node.	This	is	
not	as	likely	to	occur	with	workers	running	on	their	own	dedicated	nodes.	
M i t i g a t i n g	R i s k s	
The	above	risks	can	easily	be	mitigated	by	ensuring	the	node	is	deployed	with	adequate	CPU	and	memory	for	the	
workloads	itis	expected	to	run.	Additionally,	you	can	apply	CPU	and	memory	limits	to	the	database	or	queue	
containers	so	that	there	will	always	be	enough	resources	allocated	to	the	host	to	prevent	this	scenario.	For	more	
information,	see	Configuring	Additional	Elements	of	PowerFlow	.

Using	this	configuration	consists	of:

Docker	Swarm	requires	three	data	centers	to	maintain	quorum	of	the	swarm	in	the	event	of	afull	data	center

Because	PowerFlow	uses	the	Docker	Swarm	tool	to	maintain	its	cluster	and	automatically	re-	balance	services	
across	nodes,	ScienceLogic	strongly	recommends	that	you	implement	the	following	best	practices	from	Docker,	
Couchbase,	and	RabbitMQ	.The	topics	in	this	section	describe	those	best	practices,	along	with	requirements	and	
frequently	asked	questions.	
Requirements	Overview 

Requirements	Overview	
IMPORTANT	:To	support	automatic	failover	of	the	Couchbase	database	without	manual	intervention,	you	
must	set	up	at	least	three	nodes	for	automatic	failover	of	asingle	node,	five	nodes	for	
automatic	failover	of	two	nodes,	and	so	on.	
NOTE:	For	aclustered	PowerFlow	environment,	you	must	install	the	PowerFlow	RPM	on	every	server	that	you	
plan	to	cluster	the	PowerFlow	.You	can	load	the	Docker	images	for	the	services	onto	each	server	
locally	by	running	/opt/iservices/scripts/pull_	start_	iservices.sh	.Installing	the	RPM	onto	each	
server	ensures	that	the	PowerFlow	containers	and	necessary	data	are	available	on	all	servers	in	the	
cluster.	For	more	information,	see	Installing	PowerFlow	via	RPM	.	
NOTE:	You	can	use	acommand-	line	utility	called	pfctl	that	performs	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	on	
either	the	node	or	the	cluster.	You	can	use	this	script	to	automate	the	configuration	of	athree-	node	
cluster.	For	more	information,	see	Automating	the	Configuration	of	a	Three-	Node	Cluster	.

After	implementing	Docker	Swarm	High	Availability,	ifanode	goes	down,	all	the	services	on	that	failed	node	can	
be	dynamically	re-	provisioned	and	orchestrated	among	the	other	nodes	in	the	cluster.	High	Availability	for	Swarm	
also	facilitates	network	connections	with	the	various	other	High	Availability	components.	
Docker	Swarm	requires	the	following:	
l	The	cluster	contains	at	least	three	nodes	running	as	managers.	With	three	nodes,	there	can	be	aquorum	
vote	between	managers	when	anode	is	failed	over.	
l	A	load	balancer	with	avirtual	IP	running	in	front	of	all	nodes	in	the	cluster.	The	load	balancer	allows	user	
interface	requests	to	be	distributed	among	each	of	the	hosts	in	the	case	one	of	the	hosts	fails	for	ports	
443:HTTPS,	3141:Devpi	and	5556:Dex.	
An	example	of	why	aload	balancer	is	needed	in	front	of	the	virtual	IP	is	the	ServiceNow	ticketing	workflow.	If	
you‚Äôre	only	directing	the	request	to	asingle	node	and	that	node	goes	down,	your	ticketing	will	stop	even	ifthe	other	
PowerFlow	nodes	are	still	up	and	functional.	The	load	balancer	will	account	for	the	downed	node	and	
automatically	route	to	the	other	nodes	in	the	cluster.	
For	more	information,	see	the	Docker	High	Availability	Documentation	.	
What	happens	ifI¬†use	three	nodes	and	two	of	the	nodes	fail?	
Docker	fault	tolerance	is	limited	to	one	failure	in	athree-	node	cluster.	Ifmore	than	one	node	goes	down	in	a	
three-	node	cluster,	automatic	High	Availability	and	failover	cannot	be	guaranteed,	and	manual	intervention	may	
be	required.	Adding	more	nodes	is	the	only	way	to	increase	the	fault	tolerance.	
In	the	event	of	atwo	out	of	three	failure,	after	you	perform	manual	failover	actions,	the	PowerFlow	system	will	be	
back	up	and	running.	
For	more	information	about	the	manual	failover	steps,	see	the	Failover	section.

Couchbase	High¬†Availability	ensures	that	no	application,	configuration,	or	step	data	from	the	PowerFlow	system	
will	be	lost	in	the	event	of	anode	failure.	
To	support	automatic	failover,	Couchbase	requires	at	least	three	nodes	in	the	high	availability	cluster.	
Each	node	will	have	an	independent	and	persistent	storage	volume	that	is	replicated	throughout	the	cluster.	
Alternatively,	shared	storage	can	be	used	instead	of	independent	persistent	volumes.	This	replication	ensures	that	
data	is	replicated	in	all	places,	and	ifasingle	node	goes	down,	no	data	will	be	lost.	
For	more	information,	see	the	Couchbase	documentation	.	
What	ifIhave	three	nodes	and	two	of	them	fail?	
In	the	event	of	afailure	of	two	out	of	three	nodes,	no	data	will	be	lost,	because	the	data	is	being	replicated.	
Ifmultiple	Couchbase	data	nodes	go	down	at	the	same	time,	automatic	failover	might	not	occur	(not	even	nodes	
for	quorum	to	failover).	You	will	then	need	to	perform	manual	failover	steps.	After	you	perform	these	manual	
actions,	the	PowerFlow	system	will	be	operational	again.	For	more	information	about	the	manual	failover	steps,	
see	the	Failover	section.

Implementing	RabbitMQ	High	Availability	ensures	that	ifany	integrations	or	tasks	are	waiting	in	the	Rabbit	queue,	
those	tasks	will	not	be	lost	ifanode	containing	the	Rabbit	queue	fails.	
NOTE	:¬†You	can	switch	between	both	single-	node	and	cluster	options	at	any	time	during	deployment.	
RabbitMQ	clustering	requires	aDocker	Swarm	configuration	with	multiple	nodes.	For	more	information,	see	
Configuring	Docker	Swarm	.	
As	abest	practice	for	security,	enable	the	user	interface	only	temporarily	during	cluster	configuration.	The	default	
user	interface	login	is	guest/guest	.

With	this	configuration,	the	PowerFlow	queue	runs	on	asingle	node,	and	the	queue	is	persisted	on	disk.	As	a	
result,	ifthe	PowerFlow	stack	is	removed	and	re-	deployed,	no	messages	are	lost	during	the	downtime.	Any	
messages	that	exist	in	the	queue	before	the	stack	is	stopped	continue	to	exist	after	the	stack	is	re-	deployed.	
Potential	Risks	and	Mitigations	
Because	the	queue	runs	on	asingle	node,	ifthat	node	fails,	then	the	queue	and	its	related	data	might	be	lost.	
You	can	mitigate	data	loss	by	persisting	the	queues	on	your	choice	of	network	shared	storage,	so	that	ifthe	queue	
fails	on	one	node,	the	queue	and	its	messages	can	be	brought	back	up	on	another	node.	
Requirements	Overview 

Requirements	Overview	
Requirements/Setup	(Enabled	by	Default)	
l	You	must	define	astatic	hostname	for	the	RabbitMQ	host	in	the	docker-	compose	file.	The	default	is	rabbit_	
node1.isnet	.	
l	You	must	mount	avolume	to	/var/lib/rabbitmq	in	the	docker-	compose	file.	
Example	docker-	compose	Definition	
rabbitmq:

This	configuration	lets	multiple	nodes	join	aRabbitMQ	cluster.	When	you	include	multiple	nodes	int	he	RabbitMQ	
cluster,	all	queue	data,	messages,	and	other	necessary	information	is	automatically	replicated	and	persisted	on	all	
nodes	in	the	cluster.	Ifany	node	fails,	then	the	remaining	nodes	in	the	cluster	continue	maintaining	and	processing	
the	queue.	
Because	the	RabbitMQ	cluster	includes	disk-	persisted	queues,	ifall	nodes	in	the	Rabbit	cluster	fail,	or	ifthe	service	
is	removed	entirely,	then	no	data	loss	should	occur.	Upon	restart,	the	nodes	will	resume	with	the	same	cluster	
configuration	and	with	the	previously	saved	data.	
Ifyou	include	multiple	nodes	in	aRabbitMQ	cluster,	PowerFlow	automatically	applies	an	HA	policy	of	all-	node	
replication,	with	retroactive	queue	synchronization	disabled.	For	more	information,	refer	to	the	RabbitMQ	
documentation.
Potential	Risks	and	Mitigations	
Ifyou	create	aDocker	Swarm	cluster	with	only	two	nodes,	the	cluster	might	stop	functioning	ifasingle	node	
fails.¬†To	prevent	this	situation,	include	at	least	three	nodes	in	each	cluster.	
Requirements/Setup
For	aDocker	Swarm	configuration	with	multiple	independent	nodes:	
l	Both	RabbitMQ	services	must	be	""pinned""	to	each	of	the	two	nodes.	See	the	Example	Compose	Definition	
below.	
l	You	must	add	anew	RabbitMQ	service	to	the	docker-	compose.yml	file.	This	new	service	should	have	a	
hostname	and	alias	following	the	designated	pattern.	The	designated	pattern	is:	rabbit_	nodex.isnet	,where	x	
is	the	node	number.	This	configuration	supports	up	to	20	clustered	nodes	by	default.	
l	After	you	update	the	docker-	compose.yml	file,	the	nodes	will	auto-	cluster	when	you	perform	adeployment.

You	need	to	prepare	your	PowerFlow	system	in	the	following	ways	before	configuring	the	High	Availability	solution:	
1.	Make	sure	that	your	PowerFlow	system	has	been	updated	with	yum	upgrade	.	
2.	Run	the	following	commands	to	open	up	the	proper	firewall	ports	for	Docker	Swarm	on	each	swarm	node:	
firewall-	cmd	--add-	port=2376/tcp	--permanent	
firewall-	cmd	--add-	port=2377/tcp	--permanent	
firewall-	cmd	--add-	port=7946/tcp	--permanent

firewall-	cmd	--add-	port=4789/udp	--permanent	
firewall-	cmd	--add-	protocol=esp	--permanent	
NOTE:	Ifyour	system	is	fully	yum-	updated,	you	only	have	to	run	the	following	commands:	
firewall-	cmd	--add-	service	docker-	swarm	--permanent	
firewall-	cmd	--reload	
TIP:	To	view	alist	of	all	ports,	run	the	following	command:	firewall-	cmd	--list-	all	
3.	Make	sure	that	the	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	and	/etc/iservices/encryption_	key	are	identical	on	all	clustered	
nodes.	
4.	Make	sure	that	NTP	is	properly	configured	on	all	nodes:	
l	Edit	the	/etc/chrony.conf	file	to	add	NTP	servers.	Ifyou	want	to	use	the	pool.ntp.org	NTP	servers,	
remove	the	.ol.	from	the	domain	names.

instead	deploy	another	node	(without	using	the	PowerFlow	ISO)	and	configure	aLinux	operating	
system	based	on	Red	Hat.	You	could	then	add	that	system	to	the	swarm.

You	can	use	the	pfctl	command-	line	utility	to	perform	multiple	administrator-	level	actions	on	your¬†	PowerFlow	
cluster.	You	can	use	the	autocluster	action	with	the	pfctl	command	to	automate	the	configuration	of	athree-	node	
cluster.
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	using	another	cluster	configuration,	the	deployment	process	should	be	manual,	because	the	
pfctl	utility	only	supports	the	automated	configuration	of	athree-	node	cluster.	
WARNING:	The	autocluster	action	will	completely	reset	and	remove	all	data	from	the	system.	When	you	run	
this	action,	you	will	get	aprompt	verifying	that	you	want	run	the	action	and	delete	all	data.	
To	automate	the	configuration	of	athree-	node	cluster,	run	the	following	command:	
pfctl	--host	<is_	host1>	<username>	:<password>	--host	<is_	host2>	
<username>	:<password>	--host	<is_	host3>	<username>	:<password>	autocluster	
For	example:	
pfctl	--host	192.11.1.1	isadmin:passw0rd	--host	192.11.1.2	isadmin:passw0rd	--host	
192.11.1.3	isadmin:passw0rd	autocluster	
Running	this	command	will	configure	your	PowerFlow	three-	node	cluster	without	any	additional	manual	steps	
required.
WARNING:	Ifthe	isadmin	(host)	password	contains	aspecial	character,	such	as	an	""@""	or	""#""	symbol,	the	
password	must	be	escaped	in	the	iservicecontrol	autocluster	command	by	adding	single	
quotes,	such	as	'user:password'	.For	example:	iservicecontrol	--host	10.10.10.100	
'isadmin:testing@is'	--host	10.10.10.102	'isadmin:testing@is'	--host	
10.10.10.105	'isadmin:testing@is'	autocluster

To	configure	Docker	Swarm	for	clustering	(three	or	more	nodes)	and	High	Availability:	
NOTE:	Two-	Node	High	Availability	is	not	possible	because	Docker	Swarm	requires	an	odd	number	of	nodes	
(3+)	for	quorum	and	consensus.	
1.	Ifyou	do	not	already	have	PowerFlow	running	in	your	environment,	install	PowerFlow	on	asingle	node.	
Doing	this	creates	asingle-	node	Docker	Swarm	manager.	
2.	Ensure	that	NTP	is	configured	on	all	swarm	nodes.	For	more	information,	see	Preparing	PowerFlow	
System	for	High	Availability	.	
3.	SSH	to	the	Docker	Swarm	manager	(leader)	and	run	the	following	command	to	retrieve	the	join	token.	Make	
note	of	the	token,	because	you	will	need	itto	join	anode	to	the	swarm	in	step	4,	below:	
docker	swarm	join-	token	manager	
4.	Run	the	following	commands	on	each	Docker	Swarm	node	that	you	want	to	join	to	the	cluster:	
docker	swarm	init	
docker	swarm	join	--token	<join	token>	<swarm	manager	ip>	:<port>	
where	<join	token>	is	the	value	from	step	3.	For	example:	
docker	swarm	join	--token	SWMTKN-	1-

10.7.3.21:2377	
5.	Run	the	following	command	to	verify	that	the	nodes	have	been	added:	
docker	node	ls	
6.	Ifyou	are	using	local	images	and	not	connecting	to	Docker¬†Hub,	load	docker	images	on	the	other	swarm	
nodes:

Ifyou	have	acluster	with	three	or	more	nodes	that	is	not	configured	with	automatic	failover,	you	must	perform	the	
following	manual	failover	steps.	
NOTE	:Ifyou	can	access	the	Couchbase	Administrator	user	interface	(https://	<IP	of¬†	PowerFlow	>	:8091	)	
on	the	node	that	is	still	running,	you	can	simply	click	the	[Failover	]button	in	the	Couchbase	
Administrator	user	interface	instead	of	manually	running	the	couchbase-	cli	commands	below.	
NOTE	:In	athree-	node	cluster,	asingle	failed	node	will	be	automatically	removed,	you	will	still	need	to	
perform	are-	balance.	
To	initiate	amanual	failover:	
1.	Log	in	to	the	Docker	Swarm	node	where	the	node	that	is	running	resides.	
2.	Remove	any	failed	managers	from	the	cluster	by	running	the	following	Docker	commands:	
docker	swarm	init	--force-	new-	cluster	
docker	node	rm	<failed	node	id>	
Scaling	iservices-	contentapi 

Manual	Failover	
3.	Run	the	following	command	identify	the	Container	ID	of	the	running	Couchbase	container:	
docker	ps	
4.	Connect	to	the	Docker	container:	
docker	exec	-i	-t	<container	id>	/bin/bash	
5.	Identify	the	failed	node	by	running	the	following	commands:	
couchbase-	cli	server-	list	-c	couchbase	-u	isadmin	-p	<password>	
couchbase-	cli	server-	list	-c	couchbase-	worker	-u	isadmin	-p	<password>	
6.	One	of	the	previous	commands	will	show	afailed	node.	Copy	the	IP	address	and	port	number	of	the	failed	
node	for	step	7.	
7.	Use	the	currently	running	cluster	and	the¬†failed	node's	IP	address	and	port	to	run	the	following	command	to	
failover:	
couchbase-	cli	failover	-c	<couchbase|couchbase-	worker>	-u	isadmin	-p	<password>	-	
-server-	failover	<ip:port>	--force	
For	example,	ifthe	functioning	node	is	couchbase-	worker	,and	the	IP:Port	of	the	failed	service	is	
10.0.0.4:4379	,then	the	command	would	be:	
couchbase-	cli	failover	-c	couchbase-	worker	-u	isadmin	-p	<password>	--server-	
failover	10.0.0.4:4379	--force	
8.	Rebalance	the	cluster	using	the	functioning	container	name:	
couchbase-	cli	rebalance	-c	<cluster|cluster-	worker>	-u	isadmin	-p	<password>	
9.	In	the	unlikely	event	that	afailover	occurs	and	no	queries	can	be	performed,	validate	that	the	indexes	exist,	
and	ifnot,	rebuild	them.	To	rebuild	the	primary	indexes,	run	the	following	commands:	
cbq	-u	isadmin	
CREATE	PRIMARY	INDEX	ON	content;	
CREATE	PRIMARY	INDEX	ON	logs;	
To	recover	aDocker	Swarm	node:	
1.	Re-	deploy	the	node.	
2.	Add	anew	manager	node	to	the	swarm	stack.	
To	restore	the	failed	Couchbase	node:	
1.	Log	in	to	the	node	where	the	failed	Couchbase	cluster	node	was	pinned.	
2.	Run	one	of	the	following	commands,	depending	on	the	Couchbase	node	being	recovered:	
l	docker	service	scale	iservices_	couchbase=0	
l	docker	service	scale	iservices_	couchbase-	worker=0	
214 

215	
3.	Ifthe	Docker	Swarm	node	was	restored	and	not	rebuilt,	remove	files	from	the	old	container:	
rm	-rf	/var/data/couchbase/*	
docker	service	scale	iservices_	couchbase	scale	1	
A	new	node	is	added	to	Couchbase	that	will	automatically	re-	balance	the	cluster	after	itis	added.

In	large-	scale	clusters,	one	of	the	root	causes	of	abnormal	memory	and	CPU	usage	is	from	inter-	worker	
communication	overhead,	or	overly	""chatty""	workers,	and	their	event	queues.	You	can	completely	disable	inter-	
worker	eventing	to	significantly	reduce	overhead	on	the	queuing	system	and	prevent	the	symptoms	associated	with	
abnormal	memory	usage.	
Also,	to	improve	the	performance	of	large-	scale	clusters	by	default,	the	following	optimization	settings	were	added	
to	the	docker-	compose.yml	file	for	all	workers	in	version	2.0.1	of	the	PowerFlow	platform:	
steprunner-	<worker-	x>:	
environment:	
additional_	worker_	args:	""-	-max-	tasks-	per-	child	1	--without-	gossip	--without-	
mingle""
In	addition	to	the	default	optimization	settings	above,	you	can	further	reduce	system	overhead	by	setting	the	--	
without-	heartbeat	environment	variable	in	additional_	worker_	args	.Please	note	that	this	setting	
will	reduce	the	memory	and	CPU	utilization	of	the	system,	but	itwill	come	at	the	cost	of	preventing	the	Flower	
service	from	getting	an	accurate	depiction	of	current	worker	states.	
Ifyou	want	to	disable	these	new	configuration	settings,	set	the	environment	variable	""disable_	default_	
optimizations""	to	""True""	for	all	workers.	
NOTE:	Workers	will	continue	to	generate	events	for	consumption	from	monitoring	tools	like	Flower	even	with	
the	new	default	configuration	settings.	In	some	extremely	large	clusters,	you	might	want	to	completely	
disable	eventing	of	workers	completely,	especially	ifFlower	is	not	in	use.¬†To	completely	disable	
worker	eventing,	set	the	environment	variable	""disable_	events""	to	""True""	.	
For	more	information,	see	https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/celery.bin.worker.html#cmdoption-	
celery-	worker-	without-	gossip	
Additional	suggestions	for	improving	performance	in	large-	scale	clusters:	
l	Assess	the	impact	of	using	Flower	before	keeping	itenabled	for	along	period	of	time.	Running	Flower	can	
cause	increased	overhead	on	the	RabbitMQ	nodes,	but	the	overhead	is	not	significant	initially.	However,	the	
overhead	generated	by	Flower	will	continue	to	increase	as	more	workers	are	added	to	the	stack,	and	those	
workers	send	events	to	Flower.	
Additional	Configuration	Information 

Additional	Configuration	Information	
l	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	monitor	memory	and	queue	utilization	before	and	after	running	Flower	
with	your	current	environment	size	to	determine	whether	the	extra	overhead	provided	is	worth	the	task	
information	itprovides.	
l	Ifasystem	event	causes	workers	to	restart,	itis	possible	that	all	workers	constantly	restarting	at	the	same	time,	
every	0	seconds	will	generate	increased	load	on	the	system,	making	itdifficult	for	other	services	to	start	up.	To	
prevent	this,	itis	recommended	to	add	arestart_	delay	to	workers	to	prevent	a""rush""	of	hundreds	of	workers	
trying	to	re-	connect	over	the	network	all	at	once.	For	example:

1.	Deploy	and	cluster	the	initial	High	Availability	stack.	Label	these	nodes	as	""core"".	
2.	Create	the	PowerFlow	configuration	for	the	new¬†	PowerFlow	systems.	This	configuration	information	includes	
the	SL1	IP	address,	the	ServiceNow	user	and	domain,	and	other	related	information.	
3.	Deploy	and	cluster	the	worker	node	or	nodes	for	the	customer.	
4.	Label	the	worker	node	or	nodes	specifically	for	the	customer.	
5.	Update	the	docker-	compose.yml	file	on	acore	node:	
l	Add	two	steprunner	services	for	each	customer,	one	for	real-	time	eventing,	and	one	for	backlogged	
events,	labeled	based	on	the	organization	name:	acme	and	acme-	catchups	.	
l	Update	the	new	steprunner	hostnames	to	indicate	who	the	steprunner	works	for.	
l	Update	the	new	steprunner	deploy	constraints	to	deploy	only	to	the	designated	labels.	
l	Update	the	new	steprunner	user_	queues	environment	variable	to	only	listen	on	the	desired	queues.	
6.	Schedule	the	required	integrations	for	this	customer	:	
l	Device	Sync	daily,	ifdesired	
l	Correlation	queue	manager	running	on	the	catchup	queue	
7.	Modify	the	Run	Book	Automations	in	SL1	to	trigger	the	integration	to	run	on	the	queue	for	this	customer:	
l	Modify	the	IS_	PASSTHROUGH	dictionary	with	""queue""	setting.	
l	Specify	the	configuration	to	use	in	PowerFlow	for	this	SL1	instance.	
D e p l o y m e n t
The	following	sections	describe	how	to	deploy	PowerFlow	in	amulti-	tenant	environment.	After	the	initial	High	
Availability	(HA)	core	services	are	deployed,	the	multi-	tenant	environment	differs	in	the	deployment	and	
placement	of	workers	and	use	of	custom	queues.	
C or e	S e r v i c e	N od e s	
For	amulti-	tenant	deployment,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	dedicate	at	least	three	nodes	to	the	core	
PowerFlow	services.	These	core	PowerFlow	services	are	shared	by	all	workers	and	customers.	As	aresult,	itis	
essential	that	these	services	are	clustered	to	handle	failovers.	
Because	these	core	services	are	critical,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	initially	allocate	afairly	large	amount	
of	resources	to	these	services.	Allocating	more	resources	than	necessary	to	these	nodes	allows	you	to	further	scale	
workers	in	the	future.	Ifthese	nodes	become	overly	taxed,	you	can	add	another	node	dedicated	to	the	core	
services	in	the	cluster.	
Quick	Start	Checklist	for	Deployment 

Deployment
These	core	services	nodes	are	dedicated	to	the	following	services:	
l	API	
l	UI	
l	RabbitMQ	
l	Couchbase	
l	Redis	
Itis	critical	to	monitor	these	core	service	nodes,	and	to	always	make	sure	these	nodes	have	enough	resources	for	
new	customers	and	workers	as	they	are	on-	boarded.	
To	ensure	proper	failover	and	persistence	of	volumes	and	cluster	information,	the	core	services	must	be	pinned	to	
each	of	the	nodes.	For	more	information,	see	Configuring	Core	Service	Nodes	,below.	
R e q u i r e m e n t s	
Three	nodes	(or	more	for	additional	failover	support)	with	six	CPUs	and	56	GB	memory	each	
C o n f i g u r i n g	C o r e	S e r v i c e	N o d e s	
l	Install	the	PowerFlow	RPM	on	your	core	three	nodes.	
l	See	the	High	Availability	section	for	information	about	how	to	join	the	cluster	as	amanager,	and	copy	the	
/etc/iservices/encryption_	key	and	/etc/iservices/is_	pass	file	from	acore	service	node	to	the	new	worker	
node	(same	location	and	permissions).	
l	Create	a	label	on	the	node	and	label	these	nodes	as	""core	node"".	
l	See	the	Configuring	Clustering	and	High¬†Availability	section	for	details	on	clustering	Couchbase	and	
RabbitMQ,	and	an	example	compose	file	of	this	setup.

The	resources	allocated	to	the	worker	nodes	depends	on	the	worker	sizing	chosen,	the	more	resources	provided	to

number	of	event	syncs	per	minute,	events	will	be	queued	up,	so	the	sizing	does	not	have	to	be	exact.	The	below

When	deploying	anew	worker,	especially	ifitis	going	to	be	acustom	queue	dedicated	worker,	itis	wise	to	
consider	deploying	an	extra	worker	listening	on	the	same	queues.	Ifyou	have	on	asingle	worker	node	listening	to	
adedicated	customer	queue,	there	is	potential	for	that	queue	processing	to	stop	completely	ifthat	single	node	
worker	fails.	
For	this	reason,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	for	each	customer	dedicated	worker	you	deploy,	you	deploy	a	
second	one	as	well.	This	way	there	are	two	nodes	listening	to	the	customer	dedicated	queue,	and	ifone	node	fails,	
the	other	node	will	continue	processing	from	the	queue	with	no	interruptions.	
When	deciding	on	worker	sizing,	it's	important	to	take	this	into	consideration.	For	example,	ifyou	have	acustomer	
that	requires	afour-	CPU	node	for	optimal	throughput,	an	option	would	be	to	deploy	two	nodes	with	two	CPUs,	so	
that	there	is	failover	ifone	node	fails.

Monitoring	the	memory,	CPU	and	pending	integrations	in	queue	can	give	you	an	indication	of	whether	more	
resources	are	needed	for	the	worker.	Generally,	when	queue	times	start	to	build	up,	and	tickets	are	not	synced	
over	in	an	acceptable	time	frame,	more	workers	for	task	processing	are	required.	
Although	more	workers	will	process	more	tasks,	they	will	be	unable	to	do	so	ifthe	memory	or	CPU	required	by	the	
additional	workers	is	not	present.	When	adding	additional	workers,	itis	important	to	watch	the	memory	or	CPU	
utilization,	so	long	as	the	utilization	is	under	75%,	itshould	be	okay	to	add	another	worker.	Ifutilization	is	
consistently	over	80%,	then	you	should	add	more	resources	to	the	system	before	addling	additional	workers.

Even	ifyou	have	multiple	workers	dedicated	to	asingle	customer,	there	are	still	scenarios	in	which	aparticular	
customer	queue	spikes	in	load,	and	you'd	like	an	immediate	increase	in	throughput	to	handle	this	load.	In	this	
scenario	you	don't	have	the	time	to	deploy	anew	IS	node	and	configure	itto	distribute	the	load	for	greater	
throughput,	as	you	need	increased	load	immediately.

This	can	be	handled	by	having	anode	on	standby.	This	node	has	the	same	IS	RPM	version	installed,	and	sits	idle	in	
the	stack	(or	is	turned	off	completely).	When	aspike	happens,	and	you	need	more	resources	to	distribute	the	load,	
you	can	then	apply	the	label	to	the	corresponding	to	the	customer	who's	queues	spiked.	After	setting	the	label	on	
the	standby	node,	you	can	scale	up	the	worker	count	for	that	particular	customer.	Now,	with	the	stand-	alone	node	
labeled	for	work	for	that	customer,	additional	worker	instances	will	be	distributed	to	and	started	on	the	standby	
node.
When	the	spike	has	completed,	you	can	return	the	node	to	standby	by	reversing	the	above	process.	Decrease	the	
worker	count	to	what	itwas	earlier,	and	then	remove	the	customer	specific	label	from	the	node.

In	certain	scenarios,	you	might	not	want	to	use	the	default	RabbitMQ	queue	that	is	prepackaged	with	PowerFlow	.	
For	example,	you	might	already	have	aRabbitMQ	production	cluster	available	that	you	just	want	to	connect	with	
PowerFlow	.You	can	do	this	by	defining	anew	virtual	host	in	RabbitMQ,	and	then	you	configure	the	PowerFlow	
broker	URL	for	contentapi,	steprunner,	scheduler	services	so	that	they	point	to	the	new	virtual	host.	
Any	use	of	an	external	RabbitMQ	server	will	not	be	officially	supported	by	ScienceLogic	ifthere	are	issues	in	the	
external	RabbitMQ	instance.

By	default	RabbitMQ	contains	the	default	credentials	guest/guest	.PowerFlow	uses	these	credentials	by	default	
when	communicating	with	RabbitMQ	in	the	swarm	cluster.	All	communication	is	encrypted	and	secured	within	the	
overlay	Docker	network.	
To	add	another	user,	or	to	change	the	user	that	PowerFlow	uses	when	communicating	with	the	queues:	
1.	Create	anew	user	in	RabbitMQ	that	has	full	permissions	to	avirtual	host.	For	more	information,	see	the

When	using	an	external	RabbitMQ	system,	or	ifyou	are	using	credentials	other	than	guest/guest	to	authenticate,	
you	need	to	update	the	broker_	url	environment	variable	in	the	contentapi,	steprunner,	and	scheduler	services.	
You	can	do	this	by	modifying	the	environment	section	of	the	services	in	docker-	compose	and	changing	broker_

When	anew	SL1	system	is	to	be	onboarded	into	PowerFlow	,by	default	their	integrations	are	executed	on	the	
default	queue.	In	large	multi-	tenant	environments,	ScienceLogic	recommends	separate	queues	for	each	
customer.	Ifdesired,	each	customer	can	also	have	specific	queues.

The	first	step	to	setting	up	anew	PowerFlow	system	is	to	create	aconfiguration	object	with	variables	that	will	satisfy	
all	PowerFlow	applications.	The	values	of	these	should	be	specific	to	the	new	system	(such	as	SL1	IP	address,	
username,	password).	
See	the	example	configuration	for	atemplate	you	can	fill	out	for	new	system.	
Because	integrations	might	update	their	variable	names	from	EM7	to	SL1	in	the	future,	ScienceLogic	recommends	
to	cover	variables	for	both	em7_	and	sl1_	.The	example	configuration	contains	this	information.

Dedicating	aseparate	queue	for	each	customer	is	beneficial	in	that	work	and	events	created	from	one	system	will	
not	affect	or	slow	down	work	created	from	another	system,	provided	the	multi-	tenant	system	has	enough	resources	
allocated.	In	the	example	below,	we	created	two	new	queues	in	addition	to	the	default	queue,	and	allocated	
workers	to	it.	Both	of	these	worker	services	use	separate	queues	as	described	below,	but	run	on	the	same	labeled	
worker	node.	
Example	Queues	to	Deploy:	
l	acmequeue	.The	queue	we	use	to	sync	events	specific	from	acustomer	called	""acme"".	Only	events	syncs	
and	other	integrations	for	""acme""	will	run	on	this	queue.	
l	acmequeue-	catchup	.The	queue	where	any	old	events	that	should	have	synced	over	already	(but	failed	
due	to	PowerFlow	not	being	available	or	other	reason)	will	run.	Running	these	catchup	integrations	on	a	
separate	queue	ensures	that	real-	time	event	syncing	isn't	delayed	in	favor	of	an	older	event	catching	up.

First,	define	additional	workers	in	our	stack	that	are	responsible	for	handling	the	new	queues.	All	modifications	are	
made	in	docker-	compose-	override.yml	:	
1.	Copy	an	existing	steprunner	service	definition.	
2.	Change	the	steprunner	service	name	to	something	unique	for	the	stack:	
l	steprunner-	acmequeue	
l	steprunner-	acmequeue-	catchup	
3.	Modify	the	""replicas""	value	to	specify	how	many	workers	should	be	listening	to	this	queue:	
l	steprunner-	acmequeue	will	get	15	workers	as	it's	expecting	avery	heavy	load	
l	steprunner-	acmequeue-	catchup	will	get	3	workers	as	it's	not	often	that	this	will	run

4.	Add	anew	environment	variable	labeled	""user_	queues"".	This	environment	variable	tells	the	worker	what	
queues	to	listen	to:	
l	steprunner-	acmequeue	will	set	user_	queues=	""acmequeue""	
l	steprunner-	acmequeue-	catchup	will	set	user_	queues=""acmequeue-	catchup""	
5.	To	ensure	that	these	workers	can	be	easily	identified	for	the	queue	to	which	they	are	assigned,	modify	the	
hostname	setting	:	
l	Hostname:	""acmequeue-	{{.Task.ID}}""	
l	Hostname	""acmequeue-	catchup-	{{.Task.ID}}""	
6.	After	the	changes	have	been	made,	run	/opt/iservices/script/compose-	override.sh	to	validate	that	the	
syntax	is	correct.	
7.	When	you	are	ready	to	deploy,	re-	run	the	docker	stack	deploy	with	the	new	compose	file.	
After	these	changes	have	been	made,	your	docker-	compose	entries	for	the	new	steprunners	should	look	similar	to

In	case	of	failure,	when	can	the	worker	containers	be	expected	to	restart?	
231

l	The	worker	containers	have	astrict	memory	limit	of	2	GB.	These	containers	may	be	restarted	ifthe	service	
requests	more	memory	than	the	2	GB	limit.	
l	The	restart	is	done	by	aSIGKILL	of	the	OOM_	Killer	on	the	Linux	system.	
What	happens	when	a	worker	container	fails?	
l	Worker	containers	are	ephemeral,	and	simply	execute	the	tasks	allotted	to	them.	There	is	no	impact	to	a	
worker	instance	restarting.	
What	processing	is	affected	when	service	is	down?	
l	The	task_	reject_	on_	worker_	lost	environment	variable	dictates	whether	the	task	being	executed	at	the	time	
the	worker	was	restarted	will	be	re-	queued	for	execution	by	another	worker.	(default	false)	
l	For	more	information	about	Celery,	the	task-	processing	framework	used	by	PowerFlow	):	
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#task-	reject-	on-	worker-	lost	
What	data	can	be	lost?	
l	Workers	contain	no	persistent	data,	so	there	is	no	data	to	lose,	other	than	the	data	from	the	current	task	that	is	
being	executed	on	that	worker	when	its	shut	down	(if	there	is	one)	
l	Any	PowerFlow	application	that	fails	can	be	replayed	(and	re-	executed	by	the	workers)	on	demand	with	the	
/api/v1/tasks/<task-	id>/replay	endpoint.	
A P I
When	can	the	API	be	expected	to	restart?	
l	The	API	also	has	adefault	memory	limit.	As	with	the	steprunners	(worker	containers),	ifthe	memory	limit	is	
reached,	the	API	is	restarted	by	aSIGKILL	of	the	OOM_	Killer	on	the	Linux	system	to	prevent	amemory	leak.	
What	happens	when	itfails?	
l	On	the	clustered	system,	there	are	always	three	contentapi	services,	so	ifone	of	the	API	containers	fails,	API	
requests	will	still	be	routed	to	the	functioning	containers	through	the	internal	load	balancer.	
What	processing	is	affected	when	service	is	down?	
l	Ifnone	of	the	API	services	are	up	and	running,	any	Run	Book	Automation	calls	to	sync	an	incident	through

the¬†	PowerFlow	queries	on	aschedule	every	few	minutes.	The	next	time	that	scheduled	integration	runs,	the

Ifacore	service	node	running	Couchbase	fails,	the	database	should	continue	to	work	normally	and	continue	
processing	events,	as	long	as	asuitable	number	of	clustered	nodes	are	still	up	and	running.	Three	core	service	
nodes	provides	automatic	failover	handling	of	one	node,	five	core	service	nodes	provides	automatic	failover	
handling	of	two	nodes,	and	so	on.	See	the	High	Availability	section	for	more	information.	
Ifthere	are	enough	clustered	core	nodes	still	running,	the	failover	will	occur	with	no	interruptions,	and	the	failing	
node	can	be	added	back	at	any	time	with	no	interruptions.	
NOTE	:For	optimal	performance	and	data	distribution	after	rejoining	acluster,	you	can	click	the	[Re-	balance	]	
button	from	the	Couchbase	user	interface,	ifneeded.	
Ifthere	are	not	enough	clustered	core	nodes	still	running,	then	you	will	manually	have	to	fail	over	the	Couchbase	
Server.	In	this	scenario,	since	automatic	failover	could	not	be	performed	(due	to	too	few	nodes	available),	there	
will	be	disruption	in	event	processing.	For	more	information,	see	the	Manual	Failover	section	.	
In	case	of	failure,	when	can	Couchbase	be	expected	to	restart?	
l	In	ideal	conditions,	the	Couchbase	database	should	not	restart,	although	Couchbase	might	be	restarted	
when	the	node	itis	running	on	is	over-	provisioned.	For	more	information,	see	the	known	issue	.	
What	happens	when	itfails?	
l	Each	Couchbase	node	in	the	cluster	contains	afully	replicated	set	of	data.	Ifany	single	node	fails,	automatic	
failover	will	occur	after	the	designated	time	(120	seconds	by	default).	Automatic	failover,	processing,	and	
queries	to	the	database	will	continue	without	issue.	
l	Ifthe	database	simply	is	restarted	and	not	down	for	along	period	of	time	(120	seconds),	then	the	system	will	
not	automatically	fail	over,	and	the	cluster	will	still	be	maintained.	
l	Iftwo	out	of	three	of	the	database	nodes	fail	for	aperiod	of	time,	processing	may	be	paused	until	auser	takes	
manual	failover	action.	These	manual	actions	are	documented	in	the	Manual	Failover	section	.	
What	processing	is	affected	when	service	is	down?	
l	In	the	event	of	an	automatic	failover	(1/3	node	failure),	no	processing	will	be	affected	and	queries	to	the	
database	will	still	be	functional.	
l	In	the	event	of	alarge	failure	(2/3	node	failure)	automatic	failover	will	not	happen,	and	manual	intervention	
may	be	needed	to	so	you	can	query	the	database	again.	
What	data	can	be	lost?	
l	Every	Couchbase	node	has	full	data	replication	between	each	of	the	three	nodes.	In	the	event	of	afailure	of	
any	of	the	nodes,	no	data	is	lost,	as	areplicated	copy	exists	across	the	cluster.

RabbitMQ	clustered	among	all	core	service	nodes	provides	full	mirroring	to	each	node.	So	long	as	there	is	at	least	
one	node	available	running	RabbitMQ,	the	queues	should	exist	and	be	reachable.	This	means	that	amultiple	
node	failure	will	have	no	effect	on	the	RabbitMQ	services,	and	itshould	continue	to	operate	normally.	
In	case	of	failure,	when	can	RabbitMQ	be	expected	to	restart?	
l	Similar	to	the	Couchbase	database,	in	asmooth-	running	system,	RabbitMQ	should	never	really	restart.	
l	As	with	other	containers,	RabbitMQ	might	be	restarted	when	the	node	itis	running	on	is	over-	provisioned.	
For	more	information,	see	the	known	issue	.	
What	happens	when	RabbitMQ	fails?	
l	All	RabbitMQ	nodes	in	the	cluster	mirror	the	other	queues	and	completely	replicate	the	data	between	them.	
The	data	is	also	persisted.	
l	In	the	event	of	any	RabbitMQ	node	failure,	the	other	nodes	in	the	cluster	will	take	over	responsibility	for	
processing	its	queues.	
l	Ifall	RabbitMQ	nodes	are	restarted,	their	messages	are	persisted	to	disk,	so	any	tasks	or	messages	sitting	in	
queue	at	the	time	of	the	failure	are	not	lost,	and	are	reloaded	once	the	system	comes	back	up.	
l	In	the	event	of	anetwork	partition	(""split-	brain""	state	)RabbitMQ	will	follow	the	configured	partition	handling	
strategy	(default	autoheal).	
l	For	more	information,	see	https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-	handling	.	
What	processing	is	affected	when	service	is	down?	
l	When	this	service	is	down	completely	(no	nodes	running),	the	API	may	fail	to	place	event	sync	tasks	onto	the	
queue.	As	such,	any	Run	Book	Automation	calls	to	sync	an	incident	through	PowerFlow	will	result	in	an	error.	
l	These	failed	event	syncs	are	then	placed	in	adatabase	table	in	SL1	which	PowerFlow	queries	on	aschedule	
every	few	minutes.	The	next	time	that	scheduled	integration	runs,	the	integration	recognizes	the	events	that	
failed	to	send	to	PowerFlow	,and	the	integration	will	process	them	so	that	the	events	sync.	
What	data	can	be	lost?	
l	All	data	is	replicated	between	nodes,	so	there	is	little	risk	of	data	loss.	
l	The	only	time	there	may	be	loss	of	tasks	in	queues	is	ifthere	is	anetwork	partition,	also	called	a""split-	brain""	
state	.

In	case	of	failure,	when	can	the	user	interface	be	expected	to	restart?	
l	The	PowerFlow	user	interface	(GUI)	should	never	be	seen	as	restarted	unless	auser	forcefully	restarted	the	
interface.	
l	The	PowerFlow	user	interface	might	be	restarted	when	the	node	itis	running	on	is	over-	provisioned.	For	
more	information,	see	the	known	issue	.

What	happens	when	itfails?	
l	The	GUI	service	provides	the	proxy	routing	throughout	the	stack,	so	ifthe	GUI	service	is	not	available,	Run	
Book	Automation	POSTS	to	PowerFlow	will	fail.	However,	as	with	an	API	failure,	ifthe	Run	Book	Actions	can	
not	POST	to	PowerFlow	,those	events	will	be	placed	in	adatabase	table	in	SL1	that	PowerFlow	queries	on	a	
schedule	every	few	minutes.	The	next	time	that	scheduled	integration	runs,	the	integration	recognizes	the	
events	that	failed	to	send	to	PowerFlow	,and	the	integration	will	process	them	so	that	the	events	sync.	
l	When	the	GUI	service	is	down	and	SL1	cannot	POST	to	it,	the	syncing	of	the	events	might	be	slightly	
delayed,	as	the	events	will	be	pulled	in	and	created	with	the	next	run	of	the	scheduled	integration.	
What	data	can	be	lost?	
l	The	PowerFlow	user	interface	persists	no	data,	so	there	is	no	risk	of	any	data	loss.

Ifthe	Redis	service	fails,	itwill	automatically	be	restarted,	and	will	be	available	again	in	afew	minutes.	The	impact	
of	this	happening,	is	that	task	processing	in	PowerFlow	is	delayed	slightly,	as	the	worker	services	pause	themselves	
and	wait	for	the	Redis	service	to	become	available	again.	
Consistent	Redis	failures	
Consistent	failures	and	restarts	in	Redis	typically	indicate	your	system	has	too	little	memory,	or	the	Redis	service	
memory	limit	is	set	too	low,	or	not	low	at	all.	By	default,	PowerFlow	version	1.8.1	and	later	ships	with	adefault	
memory	limit	of	8	GB	to	ensure	that	the	Redis	service	only	ever	uses	8	GB	of	memory,	and	itejects	entries	ifitis	
going	to	go	over	that	limit.	This	limit	is	typically	sufficient,	though	ifyou	have	enough	workers	running	large	enough	
integrations	to	overfill	the	memory,	you	may	need	to	increase	the	limit.	
Before	increasing	Redis	memory	limit,	be	sure	that	there	is	suitable	memory	available	to	the	system.

Ifyou	see	multiple	containers	restarting	at	the	same	time	on	the	same	node,	itindicates	an	over-	provisioning	of	
resources	on	that	node.	This	only	occurs	on	Swarm	manager	nodes,	as	the	nodes	are	not	only	responsible	for	the	
services	they	are	running,	but	also	for	maintaining	the	Swarm	cluster	and	communicating	with	other	manager	
nodes.
Ifresources	become	over-	provisioned	on	one	of	those	manager	nodes	(as	they	were	with	the	core	nodes	when	we	
saw	the	failure),	the	Swarm	manager	will	not	be	able	to	perform	its	duties	and	may	cause	adocker	restart	on	that	
particular	node.	This	failure	is	indicated	by	‚Äúcontext	deadline	exceeded‚Äù,	and	‚Äúheartbeat	failures‚Äù	in	the	journalctl	
‚Äìno-	page	|grep	docker	|grep	err	logs.	
This	is	one	of	the	reasons	why	docker	recommends	running	‚Äúmanager-	only‚Äù	nodes,	in	which	the	manager	nodes	
are	only	responsible	for	maintaining	the	Swarm,	and	not	responsible	for	running	other	services.	Ifany	nodes	that	
are	running	PowerFlow	services	are	also	aSwarm	manager,	make	sure	that	the	nodes	are	not	over-	provisioned,	
otherwise	the	containers	on	that	node	may	restart.	For	this	reason,	ScienceLogic	recommends	monitoring	and	
placing	thresholds	at	80%	utilization.	
235 

236
To	combat	the	risk	of	over-	provisioning	affecting	the	docker	Swarm	manager,	apply	resource	constraints	on	the	
services	for	the	nodes	that	are	also	Swarm	managers,	so	that	docker	operations	always	have	some	extra	memory	
or	CPU	on	the	host	to	do	what	they	need	to	do.	Alternatively,	you	can	only	use	drained	nodes,	which	are	not	
running	any	services,	as	Swarm	managers,	and	not	apply	any	extra	constraints.	
For	more	information	about	Swarm	management,	see	https://docs.docker.com/engine/Swarm/admin_	guide/	.

The	following	test	cases	can	be	attempted	with	any	number	of	dedicated	customer	queues.	The	expectation	is	that	
each	customer	queue	will	be	filled	with	10,000	events,	and	then	you	can	time	how	long	ittakes	to	process	
through	all	10,000	events	in	each	queue.	
1.	Disable	any	steprunners.	
2.	Trigger	10,000	events	through	SL1	,and	let	them	build	up	in	the	PowerFlow	queue.	
3.	After	all	10,000	events	are	waiting	in	queue,	enable	the	steprunners	to	begin	processing.	
4.	Time	the	throughput	of	all	event	processing	to	get	an	estimate	of	how	many	events	per	second	and	per	
minute	that	PowerFlow	will	handle.	
5.	The	results	from	the	ScienceLogic	test	system	are	listed	in	the	sizing	section	of	worker	nodes	.	
Event	throughput	testing	with	SL1	triggering	PowerFlow	:	
This	test	is	executed	in	the	same	manner	as	the	event	throughput	test	described	above,	but	in	this	scenario	you	
never	disable	the	steprunners,	and	you	let	the	events	process	through	PowerFlow	as	they	are	alerted	to	by	SL1	.	
1.	Steprunners	are	running.	
2.	Trigger	10,000	events	through	SL1	,and	let	the	steprunners	handle	the	events	as	they	come	in.	
3.	Time	the	throughput	of	all	event	processing	to	get	an	estimate	of	how	many	events	per	second	and	per	
minute	that	PowerFlow	will	handle.	
The	difference	between	the	timing	of	this	test	and	the	previous	test	can	show	how	much	of	adelay	the	SL1	is	taking	
to	alert	PowerFlow	about	an	event,	and	subsequently	sync	it.	
F a i l u r e	T e s t	C a s e s	
1.	Validate	that	bringing	one	of	the	core	nodes	down	does	not	impact	the	overall	functionality	of	the	PowerFlow	
system.	Also,	validate	that	bringing	the	core	node	back	up	rejoins	the	cluster	and	the	system	continues	to	be	
operational.	
2.	Validate	that	bringing	down	adedicated	worker	node	only	affects	that	specific	workers	processing.	Also	
validate	that	adding	anew	""standby""	node	is	able	to	pick	up	the	worker	where	the	previous	failed	worker	left	
off.	
3.	Validate	that	when	the	Redis	service	fails	on	any	node,	itis	redistributed	and	is	functional	on	another	node.	
4.	Validate	that	when	aPowerFlow	application	fails,	you	can	view	the	failure	in	the	PowerFlow	Timeline.	
5.	Validate	that	you	can	query	for	and	filter	only	for	failing	tasks	for	aspecific	customer.	
Separated	queue	test	scenarios	
1.	Validate	that	scheduling	two	runs	of	the	same	application	with	differing	configurations	and	queues	works	as	
expected:	
l	Each	scheduled	run	should	be	placed	on	the	designated	queue	and	configuration	for	that	schedule.	
l	The	runs,	their	queues,	and	configurations	should	be	viewable	from	the	PowerFlow	Timeline,	or	can	
be	queried	from	the	log's	endpoint.	
Test	Cases 

Backup	Considerations	
2.	Validate	that	each	SL1	triggering	event	is	correctly	sending	the	appropriate	queue	and	configuration	that	the	
event	sync	should	be	run	on:	
l	This	data	should	be	viewable	from	the	PowerFlow	Timeline.	
l	The	queue	and	configuration	should	be	correctly	recognized	by	PowerFlow	and	executed	by	the	
corresponding	worker.	
3.	Validate	the	behavior	of	anode	left	""on	standby""	waiting	for	alabel	to	start	picking	up	work.	As	soon	as	alabel	
is	assigned	and	workers	are	scaled,	that	node	should	begin	processing	the	designated	work.

Ifmultiple	RabbitMQ	cluster	nodes	are	lost	at	once,	the	cluster	might	enter	a""Network	Partition""	or	""Split-	brain""	
state.	In	this	state,	the	queues	will	become	paused	ifthere	is	no	auto-	handling	policy	applied.	The	cluster	will	
remain	paused	until	auser	takes	manual	action.	To	ensure	that	the	cluster	knows	how	to	handle	this	scenario	as	
the	user	would	want,	and	not	pause	waiting	for	manual	intervention,	itis	essential	to	set	apartition	handling	policy.	
For	more	information	on	RabbitMQ	Network	partition	(split-	brain)	state,	how	itcan	occur,	and	what	happens,	see:	
http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html	.	
By	default,	ScienceLogic	sets	the	partition	policy	to	autoheal	in	favor	of	continued	service	ifany	nodes	go	down.	
However,	depending	on	the	environment,	you	might	wish	to	change	this	setting.	
For	more	information	about	the	automatic	split-	brain	handling	strategies	that	RabbitMQ	provides,	see:	
http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-	handling	.	
autoheal	is	the	default	setting	set	by	SL1	,and	as	such,	queues	should	always	be	available,	though	ifmultiple	
nodes	fail,	some	messages	may	be	lost.	
NOTE:	Ifyou	are	using	pause_	minority	mode	and	a""split-	brain""	scenario	occurs	for	RabbitMQ	in	asingle	
cluster,	when	the	split-	brain	situation	is	resolved,	new	messages	that	are	queued	will	be	mirrored	
(replicated	between	all	nodes	once	again).	
S c i e n c e L og i c	P ol i c y	R e c om m e n d a t i on	
ScienceLogic's	recommendations	for	applying	changes	to	the	default	policy	include	the	following:	
l	Ifyou	care	more	about	continuity	of	service	in	adata	center	outage,	with	queues	always	available,	even	if	
the	system	doesn't	retain	some	messages	from	afailed	data	center,	use	autoheal	.This	is	the	SL1	default	
setting.	
l	Ifyou	care	more	about	retaining	message	data	in	adata	center	outage,	with	queues	that	might	not	be	
available	until	the	nodes	are	back,	but	will	recover	themselves	once	nodes	are	back	online	to	ensure	that	no	
messages	are	lost,	use	pause_	minority	.	
l	Ifyou	prefer	not	to	have	RabbitMQ	handle	this	scenario	automatically	,and	you	want	to	manually	
recover	your	queues	and	data,	where	queues	will	be	paused	and	unusable	until	manual	intervention	is	made	
to	determine	where	to	fallback,	use	ignore	.

To	maintain	Swarm	health,	ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	deploy	some	swarm	managers	that	do	not	take	
any	of	the	workload	of	the	application.	The	only	purpose	for	these	managers	is	to	maintain	the	health	of	the	swarm.	
Separating	these	workloads	ensures	that	aspike	in	application	activity	will	not	affect	the	swarm	clustering	
management	services.	
ScienceLogic	recommends	that	these	systems	have	2	CPU	and	4	GB	of	memory.	
To	deploy	adrained	manager	node:	
1.	Add	your	new	manager	node	into	the	swarm.	
2.	Drain	itwith	the	following	command:	
docker	node	update	--availability	drain	<node>	
Draining	the	node	ensures	that	no	containers	will	be	deployed	to	it.	
For	more	information,	see	https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/admin_	guide/	.

There	are	two	potential	update	workflows	for	updating	the	PowerFlow	cluster.	The	first	workflow	involves	using	a	
Docker	registry	that	is	connectable	to	swarm	nodes	on	the	network.	The	second	workflow	requires	manually	
copying	the	PowerFlow	RPM	or	containers	to	each	individual	node.	
U p d a t i n g	O f f l i n e	( N o	C o n n e c t i o n	t o	a	D o c k e r	R e g i s t r y )	
1.	Copy	the	PowerFlow	RPM	over	to	all	swarm	nodes.	
2.	Only	install	the	RPM	on	all	nodes.	Do	not	stack	deploy.	This	RPM	installation	automatically	extracts	the	latest	
PowerFlow	containers,	making	them	available	to	each	node	in	the	cluster.	
3.	From	the	primary	manager	node,	make	sure	your	docker-	compose	file	has	been	updated,	and	is	now	
using	the	appropriate	version	tag:	either	latest	for	the	latest	version	on	the	system,	or	1.x.x	.	
4.	Ifall	swarm	nodes	have	the	RPM	installed,	the	container	images	should	be	runnable	and	the	stack	should	
update	itself.	Ifthe	RPM	was	missed	installing	on	any	of	the	nodes,	itmay	not	have	the	required	images,	and	
as	aresult,	services	might	not	deploy	to	that	node.

1.	Install	the	PowerFlow	RPM	only	onto	the	master	node.	
2.	Make	sure	the	RPM	doesn't	contain	any	host-	level	changes,	such	as	Docker	daemon	configuration	updates.	If	
there	are	host	level	updates,	you	might	want	to	make	that	update	on	other	nodes	in	the	cluster	
3.	Populate	your	Docker	registry	with	the	latest	PowerFlow	images.

using	the	appropriate	version	tag:	either	latest	for	the	latest	version	on	the	system,	or	1.x.x	.	
5.	Docker	stack	deploy	the	services.	Because	all	nodes	have	access	to	the	same	Docker	registry,	which	has	the	
designated	images,	all	nodes	will	download	the	images	automatically	and	update	with	the	latest	versions	as

This	section	covers	the	sizing	considerations	for	the	Couchbase,¬†RabbitMQ,	Redis,	contentapi,	and	GUI	services.	
S i z i n g	f o r	C o u c h b a s e	S e r v i c e s	
The	initial	sizing	provided	for	Couchbase	nodes	in	the	multi-	tenant	cluster	for	6	CPUs	and	56	GB	memory	should	
be	more	than	enough	to	handle	multiple	customer	event	syncing	workloads.	
ScienceLogic	recommends	monitoring	the	CPU	percentage	and	Memory	Utilization	percentage	of	the	Couchbase	
nodes	to	understand	when	agood	time	to	increase	resources	is,	such	as	when	Memory	and	CPU	are	consistently	
above	80%.	
S i z i n g	f o r	R a b b i t M Q	S e r v i c e s	
The	only	special	considerations	for	RabbitMQ	sizing	is	how	many	events	you	will	plan	for	in	the	queue	at	once.	
Every	10,000	events	populated	in	the	PowerFlow	queue	will	consume	approximately	1.5	GB	of	memory.	
NOTE:	This	memory	usage	is	drained	as	soon	as	the	events	leave	the	queue.	
S i z i n g	f o r	R e d i s	S e r v i c e s	
The	initial	sizing	deployment	for	redis	should	be	sufficient	for	multiple	customer	event	syncing.	
The	only	time	memory	might	need	to	be	increased	to	redis	is	ifyou	are	attempting	to	view	logs	from	aprevious	run,	
and	the	logs	are	not	available.	A	lack	of	run	logs	from	arecently	run	integration	indicates	that	the	redis	cache	does	
not	have	enough	room	to	store	all	the	step	and	log	data	from	recently	executed	runs.	
S i z i n g	f o r	c o n t e n t a p i	S e r v i c e s	
The	contentapi	services	sizing	should	remain	limited	at	2	GB	memory,	as	is	set	by	default.
Additional	Sizing	Considerations 

Node	Placement	Considerations	
Ifyou	notice	timeouts,	or	500s	when	there	is	alarge	load	going	through	the	PowerFlow	system,	you	may	want	to	
increase	the	number	of	contentapi	replicas.	
For	more	information,	see	placement	considerations	,and	ensure	the	API	replicas	are	deployed	in	the	same	
location	as	the	redis	instance.	
S i z i n g	f o r	t h e	G U I	S e r v i c e	
The	GUI	service	should	not	need	to	be	scaled	up	at	all,	as	itmerely	acts	as	an	ingress	proxy	to	the	rest	of	the	
PowerFlow	services.	
S i z i n g	f o r	W o r k e r s : ¬†S c h e d u l e r ,	S t e p r u n n e r ,	F l o w e r	
Refer	to	the	worker	sizing	charts	provided	by	ScienceLogic	for	the	recommended	steprunner	sizes.	
Flower	and	Scheduler	do	not	need	to	be	scaled	up	at	all.	
N o d e	P l a c e m e n t	C o n s i d e r a ti o n s

S a m e	P h y s i c a l	L oc a t i on	
An	issue	exists	where	ifthere	latency	exists	between	the	contentapi	and	redis,	the	Applications	page	may	not	load.	
This	issue	is	caused	by	the	API	making	too	many	calls	before	returning.	The	added	latency	for	each	individual	call	
can	cause	the	overall	endpoint	to	take	longer	to	load	than	the	designated	timeout	window	of	thirty	seconds.	
The	only	impact	of	this	issue	is	the	Applications	page	won't	load.	There	is	no	operational	impact	on	the	integrations	
as	awhole,	even	ifworkers	are	in	separate	geos	than	redis.	
There	is	also	no	risk	to	High	Availability¬†	(HA)	by	placing	the	API	andRredis	services	on	the	same	geo.	Iffor	whatever	
reason	that	geo	drops	out,	the	containers	will	be	restarted	automatically	in	the	other	location.

Sometimes	when	managers	lose	connection	to	each	other,	either	through	latency	or	aworkload	spike,	there	are	
instances	when	the	swarm	needs	to	be	reset	or	refreshed.	By	electing	anew	leader,	you	can	effectively	force	the	
swarm	to	redo	service	discovery	and	refresh	the	metadata	for	the	swarm.	This	procedure	is	highly	preferred	over	
removing	and	re-	deploying	the	whole	stack.	
To	elect	anew	swarm	leader:	
1.	Make	sure	there	at	least	three	swarm	managers	in	your	stack.	
2.	To	identify	which	node	is	the	current	leader,	run	the	following	command:	
docker	node	ls	
3.	Demote	the	current	leader	with	the	following	command:	
docker	node	demote	<node>	
4.	Wait	until	anew	node	is	elected	leader:

5.	After	anew	node	is	elected	leader,	promote	the	old	node	back	to	swarm	leader:

NOTE:	Ifyou	do	not	want	to	retain	any	messages	in	the	queue,	the	following	procedure	is	the	best	method	for	
recreating	the	queues.	Ifyou	do	have	data	that	you	want	to	retain,	you	can	resynchronize	RabbitMQ	
queues	.	
To	recreate	RabbitMQ	queues:	
1.	Identify	the	queue	or	queues	you	need	to	delete:	
l	Ifdefault	workers	are	restarting,	you	need	to	delete	queues	celery	and	priority.high.	
l	Ifacustom	worker	cannot	connect	to	the	queue,	simply	delete	that	worker's	queue.	
2.	Delete	the	queue	and	exchange	through	the	RabbitMQ	admin	console:	
255 

256	
l	Log	in	to	the	RabbitMQ	admin	console	and	go	to	the	[Queues	]tab.	
l	Find	the	queue	you	want	to	delete	and	click	itfor	more	details.	
l	Scroll	down	and	click	the	[Delete	Queue	]button.	
l	Go	to	the	[Exchanges	]tab	and	delete	the	exchange	with	the	same	name	as	the	queue	you	just	
deleted.	
3.	Delete	the	queue	and	exchange	through	the	command	line	interface:	
l	exec	into	arabbitmq	container	
l	Delete	the	queue	needed:	
rabbitmqadmin	delete	queue	name=	name_	of_	queue	
l	Delete	the	exchange	needed:	
rabbitmqadmin	delete	exchange	name=	name_	of_	queue	
After	you	delete	the	queues,	the	queues	will	be	recreated	the	next	time	aworker	connects.

Ifyour	RabbitMQ	cluster	ends	up	in	a""split-	brain""	or	partitioned	state,	you	might	need	to	manually	decide	which	
node	should	become	the	master.	For	more	information,	see	
http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#recovering	.	
To	resynchronize	RabbitMQ	queues:	
1.	Identify	which	node	you	want	to	be	the	master.	In	most	cases,	the	master	is	the	node	with	the	most	messages	
in	its	queue.	
2.	After	you	have	identified	which	node	should	be	master,	scale	down	all	other	RabbitMQ	services:	
docker	service	scale	iservices_	rabbitmqx=x0	
3.	After	all	other	RabbitMQ	services	except	the	master	have	been	scaled	down,	wait	afew	seconds,	and	then	
scale	the	other	RabbitMQ	services	back	to	1.	Bringing	all	nodes	but	your	new	master	down	and	back	up	
again	forces	all	nodes	to	sync	to	the	state	of	the	master	that	you	chose.

For	example:	
docker	service	ps	--no-	trunc	iservices_	redis	
Common	Resolution	Explanations 

Common	Resolution	Explanations	
From	the	command	result	above,	we	see	that	one	container	with	the	ID	3s7s86n45skf	failed	previously	running	
on	node	is-	scale-	03	(non-	zero	exit)	and	another	container	was	restarted	in	its	place.	
At	this	point,	you	can	ask	the	following	questions:	
l	Is	the	error	when	using	docker	service	ps	--no-	trunc	something	obvious?	Does	the	error	say	that	it	
cannot	mount	avolume,	or	that	the	image	was	not	found?	Ifso,	that	is	most	likely	the	root	cause	of	the	issue	
and	needs	to	be	addressed.	
l	Did	the	node	on	which	that	container	was	running	go	down?	Or	is	that	node	still	up?	
l	Are	the	other	services	running	on	that	node	running	fine,	and	was	only	this	service	affected?	Ifother	services	
are	running	fine	on	that	same	node,	itis	probably	aproblem	with	the	service	itself.	Ifall	services	on	that	node	
are	not	functional,	itcould	mean	anode	failure.	
At	this	point,	the	cause	of	the	issue	is	not	adeploy	configuration	issue,	and	itis	not	an	entire	node	failure.	The	
problem	exists	within	the	service	itself.	Continue	to	Step	2	ifthis	is	the	case.	
Step	2:	Check	for	any	interesting	error	messages	or	logs	indicating	an	error	
Using	the	ID	obtained	in	Step	1,	collect	the	logs	from	the	failed	container	with	the	following	command:	
docker	service	logs	<failed-	id>	
For	example:	
docker	service	logs	3s7s86n45skf	
Review	the	service	logs	for	any	explicit	errors	or	warning	messages	that	might	indicate	why	the	failure	occurred.

Index	stuck	in	‚Äúcreated‚Äù	(not	ready)	state	
This	situation	usually	occurs	when	anode	starts	creating	an	index,	but	another	index	creation	was	performed	at	the	
same	time	by	another	node.	After	the	index	is	created,	you	can	run	asimple	query	to	build	the	index	which	will	
change	itfrom	created	to	‚Äúready‚Äù:

are	only	populated	in	docker-	compose-	override,	this	is	not	necessary,	but	you	might	want	abackup	copy.	
l	Make	sure	that	each	node	in	Couchbase	is	fully	replicated,	and	no	re-	balancing	is	necessary.	
Clean	out	old	container	images	ifdesired	
Before	upgrading	to	the	latest	version	of	PowerFlow	,check	the	local	file	system	and	see	ifthere	are	any	older	
versions	taking	up	space	that	you	might	want	to	remove.	These	containers	exist	both	locally	on	the	fs	and	the	
internal	docker	registry.	To	view	any	old	container	versions,	check	the	/opt/iservices/images	directory.	
ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	keep	at	aminimum	the	last	version	of	containers,	so	you	can	downgrade	if	
necessary.
Cleaning	out	images	is	not	mandatory,	but	itis	just	ameans	of	clearing	out	additional	space	on	the	system	if	
necessary.
To	remove	old	images:	
1.	Delete	any	unwanted	versions	in	/opt/iservices/images	.	
2.	Identify	any	unwanted	images	known	to	Docker	with	docker	images.	
3.	Remove	the	images	with	the	ID	docker	rmi	<id>	.	
P r e p a r e	t h e	S y s t e m s	
Install	the	new	RPM	
259 

260
The	first	step	of	upgrading	is	to	install	the	new	RPM	on	all	systems	in	the	stack.	Doing	so	will	ensure	that	the	new	
containers	are	populated	onto	the	system	(if	using	that	particular	RPM),	and	any	other	host	settings	are	changed.	
RPM	installation	does	not	pause	any	services	or	affect	the	docker	system	in	any	way,	other	than	using	some	
resources.
PowerFlow	has	two	RPMs,	one	with	containers	and	one	without.	Ifyou	have	populated	an	internal	docker	registry	
with	docker	containers,	you	can	install	the	RPM	without	containers	built	in.	Ifno	internal	docker	repository	is	
present,	you	must	install	the	RPM	which	has	the	containers	built	in	it.	Other	than	the	containers,	there	is	no	
difference	between	the	RPMs.	
For	advanced	users,	installing	the	RPM	can	be	skipped.	However	this	means	that	the	user	is	completely	
responsible	for	maintaining	the	docker-	compose	and	host	level	configurations.	
To	install	the	RPM:	
1.	SSH	into	each	node.	
2.	Ifinstalling	the	RPM	which	contains	the	container	images	built	in,	you	may	want	to	upgrade	each	core	node	
one	by	one,	so	that	the	load	of	extracting	the	images	doesn't	affect	all	core	nodes	at	once	
3.	Run	the	following	command:	
rpm	-Uvh	<new-	rpm-	file>	
Compare	compose	file	changes	and	resolve	differences	
After	the	RPM	is	installed,	you	will	notice	anew	docker-	compose	file	is	placed	at	/etc/iservices/scripts/docker-	
compose.ym	l.As	long	as	your	environment-	specific	changes	exist	solely	in	the	compose-	override	file,	all	user	
changes	and	new	version	updates	will	be	resolved	into	that	new	docker-	compose.yml	file.	
ScienceLogic	recommends	that	you	check	the	differences	between	the	two	docker-	compose	files.	You	should	
validate	that:	
1.	All	environment-	specific	and	custom	user	settings	that	existed	in	the	old	docker-	compose	also	exist	in	the	new	
docker-	compose	file.	
2.	The	image	tags	reference	the	correct	version	in	the	new	docker-	compose.	Ifyou	are	using	an	internal	docker	
registry,	be	sure	these	image	tags	represent	the	images	from	your	internal	registry.	
3.	Make	sure	that	any	new	environment	variables	added	to	services	are	applied	to	replicated	services.	To	
ensure	these	updates	persist	through	the	next	upgrade,	also	make	the	changes	in	docker-	compose-	
override.yml.	In	other	words,	ifyou	added	anew	environment	variable	for	Couchbase,	make	sure	to	apply	
that	variable	to	couchbase-	worker1	and	couchbase-	worker2	as	well.	Ifyou	added	anew	environment	
variable	for	the	default	steprunner,	make	sure	to	set	the	same	environment	variable	on	each	custom	worker	
as	well.	
4.	Ifyou	are	using	the	latest	tag	for	images,	and	you	are	using	aremote	repository	for	downloading,	be	sure	that	
the	latest	tag	refers	to	the	images	in	your	repository.	
5.	The	old	docker-	compose	is	completely	unchanged,	and	itmatches	the	current	deployed	environment.	This	
enables	PowerFlow	to	update	services	independently	without	restarting	other	services.	
6.	After	you	resolve	any	differences	between	the	compose	files	has	been	resolved,	proceed	with	the	upgrade	
using	the	old	docker-	compose.yml	(the	one	that	matches	the	currently	deployed	environment).	
Make	containers	available	to	systems	
PowerFlow	Multi-	tenant	Upgrade	Process 

PowerFlow	Multi-	tenant	Upgrade	Process	
After	you	apply	the	host-	level	updates,	you	should	make	sure	that	the	containers	are	available	to	the	system.	
Ifyou	upgraded	using	the	RPM	with	container	images	included,	the	containers	should	already	be	on	all	of	the	
nodes,	you	can	run	docker	images	to	validate	the	new	containers	are	present.	Ifthis	is	the	case	you	may	skip	to	the	
next	section.	
Ifthe	upgrade	was	performed	using	the	RPM	which	did	not	contain	the	container	images,	ScienceLogic	
recommends	that	you	run	the	following	command	to	make	sure	all	nodes	have	the	latest	images:	
docker-	compose	-f	<new_	docker_	compose_	file>	pull	
This	command	validates	that	the	containers	specified	by	your	compose	file	can	be	pulled	and	reached	from	the	
nodes.	While	not	required,	you	might	to	make	sure	that	the	images	can	be	pulled	before	starting	the	upgrade.	If	
the	images	are	not	pulled	manually,	they	will	automatically	be	pulled	by	Docker	when	the	new	image	is	called	for	
by	the	stack.	
P e r f or m	t h e	U p g r a d e	
To	perform	the	upgrade	on	aclustered	system	with	little	downtime,	PowerFlow	re-	deploys	services	to	the	stack	in	
groups.	To	do	this,	PowerFlow	gradually	makes	the	updates	to	groups	of	services	and	re-	runs	docker	stack	deploy	
for	each	change.	To	ensure	that	no	unintended	services	are	updated,	start	off	using	the	same	docker-	compose	file	
that	was	previously	used	to	deploy.	Reusing	the	same	docker-	compose	file	and	updating	only	sections	at	atime	
ensures	that	only	the	intended	services	to	be	updated	are	affected	at	any	given	time.	
Avoid	putting	all	the	changes	in	asingle	docker-	compose	file,	and	do	anew	docker	stack	deploy	with	all	changes	
at	once.	Ifdowntime	is	not	aconcern,	you	can	update	all	services,	but	updating	services	gradually	allows	you	to	
have	little	or	no	downtime.	
WARNING:	Before	upgrading	any	group	of	services,	be	sure	that	the	docker-	compose	file	you	are	deploying	
from	is	exactly	identical	to	the	currently	deployed	stack	(the	previous	version).	Start	with	the	same	
docker-	compose	file	and	update	itfor	each	group	of	services	as	needed,

The	first	group	to	update	includes	Redis,	Scheduler	and	Flower.	Ifdesired,	this	group	can	be	upgraded	along	with	
any	other	group.	
To	update:
1.	Copy	the	service	entries	for	Redis,	Scheduler	and	Flower	from	the	new	compose	file	into	the	old	docker-	
compose	file	(the	file	that	matches	the	currently	deployed	environment).	Copying	these	entries	makes	itso	
that	the	only	changes	in	the	docker-	compose	file	(compared	to	the	deployed	stack)	are	changes	for	Redis,	
Scheduler	and	Flower.	
2.	Run	the	following	command:	
docker	stack	deploy	-c	<old_	compose_	with_	small_	changes>	iservices	
3.	Monitor	the	update,	and	wait	until	all	services	are	up	and	running	before	proceeding.

Redis	Version	
As	the	Redis	version	might	not	change	with	every	release	of	PowerFlow	,there	might	not	be	any	changes	needed	in	
the	upgrade	for	Redis.	This	can	be	expected	and	is	not	an	issue.	
Flower	Dashboard	
Due	to	aknown	issue	addressed	in	version	1.8.3	of	PowerFlow	,the	Flower	Dashboard	might	not	display	any	
workers.	Flower	eventually	picks	up	the	new	workers	when	they	are	restarted	in	the	worker	group.	Ifthis	is	a	
concern,	you	can	perform	the	Flower	upgrade	in	the	same	group	as	the	workers.
PowerFlow	Multi-	tenant	Upgrade	Process 

PowerFlow	Multi-	tenant	Upgrade	Process	
U p g r a d e	C o r e	S e r v i c e s	( R a b b i t	a n d	C o u c h b a s e )	
The	next	group	of	services	to	update	together	are	the	RabbitMQ/Couchbase	database	services,	as	well	as	the	
GUI.	Because	the	core	services	are	individually	defined	and	""pinned""	to	specific	nodes,	upgrade	these	two	services	
at	the	same	time,	on	anode-	by-	node	basis.	In	between	each	node	upgrade,	wait	and	validate	that	the	node	
rejoins	the	Couchbase	and	Rabbit	clusters	and	re-	balances	appropriately.	
Because	there	will	always	be	two	out	of	three	nodes	running	these	core	services,	this	group	should	not	cause	any	
downtime	for	the	system.	
Rabbit/Couchbase	Versions	
The	Couchbase	and	RabbitMQ	versions	used	might	not	change	with	every	release	of	PowerFlow	.Ifthere	is	no	
update	or	change	to	be	made	to	the	services,	you	can	ignore	this	section	for	RabbitMQ	or	Couchbase	upgrades,	
or	both.	Assess	the	differences	between	the	old	and	new	docker-	compose	files	to	check	ifthere	is	an	image	or	
environment	change	necessary	for	the	new	version.	Ifnot,	you	can	move	on	to	the	next	section.	
Update	Actions	(assuming	three	core	nodes)	
To	update	first	node	services:	
1.	Update	just	core	node01	by	copying	service	entries	for	couchbase,	rabbitmq1	from	the	new	compose	file	
(compared	and	resolved	as	part	of	above	prepare	steps)	into	the	old	docker-	compose	file.	At	this	point,	the	
compose	file	you	use	to	deploy	should	also	contain	the	updates	for	the	previous	groups	
2.	Before	deploying,	access	the	Couchbase	user	interface,	select	the	first	server	node,	and	click	""failover"".	
Select	graceful	failover.	Manually	failing	over	before	updating	ensures	that	the	system	is	still	operational	
when	the	container	comes	down.	
3.	For	the	failover	command	that	can	be	run	through	the	command-	line	interface	ifthe	user	interface	is	not	
available,	see	the	Manual	Failover	section	.	
4.	Run	the	following	command:	
docker	stack	deploy	-c	<compose_	file>	
5.	Monitor	the	process	to	make	sure	the	service	updates	and	restarts	with	the	new	version.	To	make	sure	that	as	
little	time	as	possible	is	used	when	updating	the	database,	the	database	containers	should	already	be	
available	on	the	core	nodes.	
6.	After	the	node	is	back	up,	go	back	to	the	Couchbase	UI	and	add	the	node	back,	and	rebalance	the	cluster	to	
make	itwhole	again.	
7.	For	more	information	on	how	to	re-	add	the	node	and	rebalance	the	cluster	ifthe	user	interface	is	not	
available,	see	the	Manual	Failover	section	.	
First	node	Couchbase	update	considerations	:	
l	When	updating	the	first	couchbase	node,	be	sure	to	set	the	environment	variable	JOIN_	ON:	""couchbase-	
worker2"",	so	that	the	couchbase	master	knows	to	rejoin	the	workers	after	restarting	
l	Keep	in	mind	by	default,	only	the	primary	Couchbase	node	user	interface	is	exposed.	Because	of	this,	when	
the	first	Couchbase	node	is	restarted,	the	Couchbase	admin	user	interface	will	be	inaccessible.	Ifyou	would	
like	to	have	the	Couchbase	user	interface	available	during	the	upgrade	of	this	node,	ensure	that	at	least	one	
other	Couchbase-	worker	services	port	is	exposed.	
263 

264
Special	GUI	consideration	with	1.8.3	
In	the	upgrade	to	version	1.8.3	of	PowerFlow	,the	Couchbase	and	RabbitMQ	user	interface	ports	will	be	exposed	
through	PowerFlow	user	interface	with	HTTPS.	To	ensure	there	is	no	port	conflict	between	services	and	PowerFlow	
user	interface,	ensure	that	the	Couchbase	and	RabbitMQ	user	interface	port	mappings	are	removed	or	modified	
from	the	default	(8091)	admin	port.	To	avoid	conflicts,	make	sure	the	new	PowerFlow	user	interface	definition	
does	not	conflict	with	the	Couchbase	or	RabbitMQ	definitions.	
l	Modifying	the	port	mapping	(exposing	to	adifferent	port	than	8091)	means	itwill	still	be	exposed	via	HTTP	
through	aport	other	than	8091	until	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	is	upgraded,	at	which	point	that	port	can	
then	be	closed.	
l	Removing	the	port	means	no	port	mapping	will	be	defined	to	8091	for	the	Couchbase	service,	and	the	
Couchbase	user	interface	will	be	inaccessible	until	the	PowerFlow	user	interface	is	updated.	
The	PowerFlow	user	interface	will	not	update	until	all	port	conflicts	are	resolved.	You	can	upgrade	the	PowerFlow	
user	interface	at	any	time	after	this	has	been	done,	but	be	sure	to	first	review	the	Update	the	GUI	topic,	below.	
NOTE:	You	can	manually	remove	port	mappings	from	aservice	with	the	following	command,	though	the	
command	will	restart	the	service:	docker	service	update	--publish-	rm	
published=8091,target=8091	iservices_	couchbase

Update	second,	and	third	node	services	
To	update	the	second	and	third	node	services,	repeat	the	steps	from	the	first	node	on	each	node	until	all	nodes	are	
re-	clustered	and	available.	Be	sure	to	check	the	service	port	mappings	to	ensure	that	there	are	no	conflicts	(as	
described	above),	and	remove	any	HTTP	ports	ifyou	choose.	
U p d a t e	t h e	G U I	
You	can	update	the	GUI	service	along	with	any	other	group,	but	due	to	the	port	mapping	changes	in	version	1.8.3	
of	PowerFlow	,you	should	update	this	service	after	the	databases	and	RabbitMQ	nodes	have	been	updated,	and	
their	port	mappings	no	longer	conflict.	
Since	the	GUI	service	provides	all	ingress	proxy	routing	to	the	services,	there	might	be	avery	small	window	where	
PowerFlow	might	not	receive	API	requests	as	the	GUI	(proxy)	is	not	running.	This	downtime	is	limited	to	the	time	it	
takes	for	the	GUI	container	to	restart.	
To	update	the	user	interface:	
1.	Make	sure	that	any	conflicting	port	mappings	are	handled	and	addressed.	
2.	Replace	the	docker-	compose	GUI	service	definition	with	the	new	one.	
3.	Re-	deploy	the	docker-	compose	file,	and	validate	that	the	new	GUI	container	is	up	and	running.	
4.	Make	sure	that	the	HTTPS	ports	are	accessible	for	Couchbase/RabbitMG.	
U p d a t e	W o r k e r s	a n d	c o n t e n t a p i	
You	should	update	the	workers	and	contentapi	last.	Because	these	services	use	multiple	replicas	(multiple	
steprunner	or	containerapi	containers	running	per	service),	you	can	rely	on	Docker	to	incrementally	update	each	
replica	of	the	service	individually.	By	default,	when	aservice	is	updated,	itwill	update	one	container	of	the	service	
at	atime,	and	only	after	the	previous	container	is	up	and	stable	will	the	next	container	be	deployed.	
You	can	utilize	additional	Docker	options	in	docker-	compose	to	set	the	behavior	of	how	many	containers	to	update	
at	once,	when	to	bring	down	the	old	container,	and	what	happens	ifacontainer	upgrade	fails.	See	the	update_	
config	and	rollback_	config	options	available	in	Docker	documentation:	
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-	file/	.	
Upgrade	testing	was	performed	by	ScienceLogic	using	default	options.	An	example	where	these	settings	are	
helpful	is	to	change	the	parallelism	of	update_	config	so	that	all	worker	containers	of	aservice	update	at	the	same	
time.	
265 

266
The	update	scenario	described	below	takes	extra	precautions	and	only	updates	one	node	of	workers	per	customer	
at	atime.	Ifyou	decide,	you	can	also	safely	update	all	workers	at	once.	
To	update	the	workers	and	contentapi:	
1.	Modify	the	docker-	compose	file,	the	contentapi,	and	""worker_	node1""	services	of	all	customers	to	use	the	new	
service	definition.	
2.	Run	adocker	stack	deploy	of	the	new	compose	file.	Monitor	the	update,	which	should	update	the	API	
container	one	instance	at	atime,	always	leaving	acontainer	available	to	service	requests.	The	process	
updates	the	workers	of	node1	one	container	instance	at	atime	by	default.	
3.	After	workers	are	back	up	and	the	API	is	fully	updated,	modify	the	docker-	compose	file	and	update	the	
second	node's	worker's	service	definitions.	
4.	Monitor	the	upgrade,	and	validate	as	needed.	
Example	docker-	compose	definition	with	one	of	two	worker	nodes	and	contentapi	updated:

Veritas NetBackup ‚Ñ¢ 9.0 - 9.x.x Database and Application Agent Compatibility List
	
 Note the following:
 NetBackup 9.0 does not capture Extended Attributes (xattrs) or Access Control Lists (ACLs) of an object during backup and hence these are not set on the restored files or folders.
 If the Access Control Lists (ACLs) are enabled and set on any of the files or directories that is backed up then, you have to explicitly set the ACLs on the restored data.
 The backup host can be a NetBackup 9.0 client or a 9.0 media server or a 9.0 master server. Hadoop Plugin needs to be installed on the NetBackup client or a media server or a
master server to make it a Backup Host. Veritas recommends that you have media server as a backup host.
 NetBackup supports installation of the backup host in a virtual machine. The guest operating systems that NetBackup supports are same as the above.
 For a Hadoop cluster that uses Kerberos, Ensure that the Kerberos client (krb5_workstation package) is present on all the backup hosts with kdcserver details.
 NetBackup 8.1 does not support Hadoop cluster that uses Delegation token authentication
 Hadoop implementation on an Isilon clusters is not supported.
 For protection of HIVE data residing on Hadoop cluster. Refer: <https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100044318.html>
 SSL for Hadoop is supported with NetBackup 9.0 release. Please refer NetBackup Hadoop Admin guide for additional Information

4. Kofax Equitrac
Kofax Equitrac is a print management solution designed to simplify printer management. 
Printing costs can be monitored, and can be reduced by forcing users to follow budget saving printing habits. 
Secure and regulations-compliant printing is made possible by allowing users to 'pick up' and print their secure
documents in person at any printer. Flexible printing is achieved as users can print from anywhere, at anytime,
and print from wherever they like.
5. Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 
5.1. Introduction and Overview of Different Modes
This guide details the configuration of a high availability DCE cluster for Equitrac Office and Express, using a 
Loadbalancer.org appliance. 
For a Kofax Equitrac deployment, the preferred and default load balancer configuration uses Layer 4 DR Mode 
(Direct Routing, aka DSR / Direct Server Return). This is a very high performance solution that requires little	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 3   

change to your existing infrastructure. It is necessary to solve ""the ARP problem"" on the real print servers. This is 
a straightforward process, and is detailed in the section 	
Configuring Print Servers for Load Balancing	.
It is also possible to load balance a Kofax Equitrac deployment using Layer 7 SNAT Mode. This mode might be 
preferable if making changes to the real print servers is not possible, although some Windows Registry keys need
to be added. Due to the increased amount of information at layer 7, performance is not as fast as at layer 4. Also
note that load balanced connections at layer 7 are not source IP transparent, which is not usually an issue when
load balancing print servers but should still be considered.	
5.2. Prerequisites
A load balanced Kofax Equitrac environment requires the following:	
ÔÑëMicrosoft Windows Server environment
ÔÑëInstallation of DCE server and Couchbase in High Availability setup
For installation instructions, refer to the Kofax support.	
5.3. Overview of steps required
Setting up a load balanced Kofax Equitrac environment can be summarised as follows:	
ÔÑëCreate a virtual service (VIP) on the load balancer that listens on the required ports
ÔÑëAssociate the print servers to the virtual service, i.e. define them as 'real servers' (RIPs) for the VIP
ÔÑëInstall and configure the Kofax Equitrac DCE Windows print servers
ÔÑëConfigure registry settings on the print servers to enable them to be accessed via a shared name
ÔÑëConfigure name resolution related settings on the print servers
ÔÑëPoint users at the VIP to access the print server and the printer shares

1.	Join the server to the same domain as the client PCs.	
2.	Install the  Print and Document Service  role / Print Server  service.	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 11    

3.	Install and share the printers (use exactly the same share names and permissions across all servers).	
4.	If DR mode is used, solve the ""ARP problem"" on each print server, to that DR mode will work. For detailed 
steps on solving the ARP problem for the various versions of Windows, please refer to 	
Solving the ARP
Problem	
 for more information.	
When configuring the Loopback Adapter to solve the ARP Problem, the following options  must
also be checked (ticked):
Client for Microsoft Networks & File & Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks	
9.1. Registry Modifications
To enable the print servers to be accessed via a shared name ( EQDCEHA in the example virtual service in this
guide), add the following registry entries to each print server:
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Value: DisableLoopbackCheckType: REG_DWORDData: 1
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters Value: DisableStrictNameCheckingType: REG_DWORDData: 1
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters Value: OptionalNamesType: REG_MULTI_SZData: EQDCEHA	
In the example presented here, EQDCEHA is the name that will be used to access the load 
balanced print servers via the virtual service (VIP) created on the load balancer. This can be set
to any appropriate name. Whatever name is used, it must resolve to the IP address of the VIP as
explained in the section below.	
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Specific Registry Change
If Microsoft Windows Server 2008 is used as the operating system for the printer servers, an additional registry 
entry change is required. The following registry entry should be changed from a DWORD to a QWORD:
Key: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\DNSOneWire Value: DnsOnWireType: REG_QWORDData: 1	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 12    

9.2. Configuring Name Resolution
For printer load balancing to work, either DNS or NetBIOS name resolution should be configured as detailed
below.
DNS Name Resolution (Windows 2000 & later)
To configure DNS name resolution, the following steps should be completed:	
1.	NetBIOS over TCP/IP should be disabled on  all interfaces of  each print server, as shown here:	
2.	A host name and corresponding ""Host (A)"" record for the virtual DCE that matches the virtual IP (VIP) 
address for the load balancer should be created.
When configuring printers to connect back to the highly available DCE, the DCE hostname / IP address should be
the VIP address and not the individual DCE host name or IP address.	
NetBIOS Name Resolution (legacy Environments)
To configure NetBIOS name resolution, the following steps should be completed:	
1.	NetBIOS over TCP/IP should be  disabled on the main NIC and left enabled on the Loopback adapter  on
each  print server.	
2.	Either a WINS server should be set up and all clients configured to use this,  or pre-loaded entries in the
LMHosts file of each client should be set up.	
As shown in the flow chart in 	this Technet article	, for a default H-node client, NetBIOS name	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 13    

resolution occurs in the following order:	
1.	Local NetBIOS cache.	
2.	WINS server.	
3.	NetBIOS broadcast.	
4.	Local LMHosts file.
Therefore, to avoid broadcast, LMHost entries must be declared as pre-loaded to ensure they 
are available in the local NetBIOS cache.	
Configuring the LMHosts file
This is done by creating an entry like so:
EQDCEHA 192.168.100.10 #PRE
Entries with the #PRE directive are loaded into the cache on reboot, or can be forced using the command:
nbtstat -R
The following command can be used to view the cache and verify that the entry has been added:
nbtstat -c
9.3. Finalising the Server Configuration
To finalise the print server configuration changes,  each print server must be rebooted.
10. Testing & Verification	
For additional guidance on diagnosing and resolving any issues you may have, please also refer to 	
Diagnostics & Troubleshooting	.
The load balanced print service can be tested, either by browsing to the virtual service IP address or the share 
name. In the example presented in this document, this would be done by going to	
\10.10.10.190
or
\EQDCEHA
Any shared printers and shared folders that have been configured on the real print servers should be visible.

13. Appendix 
13.1. Solving the ARP Problem
Windows Server 2012 & Later
Windows Server 2012 and later support Direct Routing (DR) mode through the use of the Microsoft Loopback 
Adapter that must be installed and configured on each load balanced (Real) Server. The IP address configured on
the Loopback Adapter must be the same as the Virtual Service (VIP) address. This enables the server to receive
packets that have their destination set as the VIP address. If a Real Server is included in multiple DR mode VIPs,
an IP address for each VIP must be added to the Loopback Adapter. 
In addition, steps must be taken to set the strong/weak host behavior on each Real Server. This is used to either 
prevent or allow interfaces to receive packets destined for a different interface on the same server.	
The following 3 steps must be completed on all Real Servers associated with the VIP.	
Step 1 of 3: Install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter	
1.	Click  Start, then run  hdwwiz to start the Hardware Installation Wizard.	
2.	Once the Wizard has started, click  Next.	
3.	Select  Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced) , click Next.	
4.	Select  Network adapters , click Next.	
5.	Select  Microsoft  & Microsoft KM-Test Loopback Adapter , click Next.	
6.	Click  Next to start the installation, when complete click  Finish.	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 16    

Step 2 of 3: Configure the Loopback Adapter	
1.	Open Control Panel and click Network and Sharing Center.	
2.	Click Change adapter settings .	
3.	Right-click the new Loopback Adapter and select  Properties.	
You can configure IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or both depending on your requirements.
when configuring the loopback adapter properties, make sure that  Client for Microsoft
Networks  and File & Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks  is also checked as shown below.
IPv4 Addresses	
1.	Uncheck all items except  Client for Microsoft Networks , File & Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks  and
Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)  as shown below:	
2.	Ensure that Internet Protocol Version (TCP/IPv4)  is selected, click Properties and configure the IP address
to be the same as the Virtual Service address (VIP) with a subnet mask of  255.255.255.255, e.g.
192.168.2.20/255.255.255.255  as shown below:	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 17     

192.168.2.20 is an example, make sure you specify the correct VIP address.
If a Real Server is included in multiple DR mode VIPs, an IP address for each VIP must be 
added to the Loopback Adapter.	
3.	Click OK then click  Close to save and apply the new settings.
IPv6 Addresses	
1.	Uncheck all items except  Client for Microsoft Networks , File & Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks  and
Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)  as shown below:	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 18     

2.	Ensure that Internet Protocol Version (TCP/IPv6)  is selected, click Properties and configure the IP address
to be the same as the Virtual Service (VIP) and set the  Subnet Prefix Length to be the same as your network
setting, e.g.  2001:470:1f09:e72::15/64  as shown below:	
2001:470:1f09:e72::15/64 is an example, make sure you specify the correct VIP address.
If a Real Server is included in multiple DR mode VIPs, an IP address for each VIP must be	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 19      

added to the Loopback Adapter.	
3.	Click OK then click  Close to save and apply the new settings.	
Step 3 of 3: Configure the strong/weak host behavior
The strong/weak host behavior can be configured using either of the following 2 methods:	
ÔÑëOption 1 - Using Network Shell (netsh) commands
ÔÑëOption 2 - Using PowerShell cmdlets
The commands in this section assume that the LAN Adapter is named "" net"" and the Loopback Adapter is named
"" loopback "" as shown in the example below:	
Either adjust the commands to use the names allocated to your LAN and loopback adapters, or 
rename the adapters before running the commands. Names are case sensitive so make sure
that the interface names used in the commands match the adapter names exactly.
Option 1 - Using Network Shell (netsh) Commands 
To configure the correct strong/weak host behavior run the following commands:
For IPv4 addresses:

13.2. Configuring HA - Adding a Secondary Appliance
Our recommended configuration is to use a clustered HA pair of load balancers to provide a highly available and 
resilient load balancing solution. 
We recommend that the Primary appliance is configured first and then the Secondary should be added. Once the 
Primary and Secondary are paired, all load balanced services configured on the Primary are automatically
replicated to the Secondary over the network using SSH/SCP.	
For Enterprise Azure, the HA pair should be configured first. In Azure, when creating a VIP using 
an HA pair, 2 private IPs must be specified ‚Äì one for the VIP when it‚Äôs active on the Primary and
one for the VIP when it‚Äôs active on the Secondary. Configuring the HA pair first, enables both IPs
to be specified when the VIP is created.
The clustered HA pair uses Heartbeat to determine the state of the other appliance. Should the active device 
(normally the Primary) suffer a failure, the passive device (normally the Secondary) will take over.	
Non-Replicated Settings
A number of settings are not replicated as part of the Primary/Secondary pairing process and therefore must be 
manually configured on the Secondary appliance. These are listed by WebUI menu option in the table below:
WebUI Main Menu 
Option	Sub Menu Option	Description	
Local Configuration	Hostname & DNS	Hostname and DNS settings	
Local Configuration	Network Interface

configuration and VLANs	
Local Configuration	Routing	Routing configuration including default gateways and static routes	
Local Configuration	System Date & time	All time and date related settings

Local Configuration	License Key	Appliance licensing	
Maintenance	Software Updates	Appliance software update management	
Maintenance	Firewall Script	Appliance firewall (iptables) configuration	
Maintenance	Firewall Lockdown 
Wizard	Appliance management lockdown settings	
Make sure that if these settings/updates have been configured on the Primary appliance, they‚Äôre 
also configured on the Secondary appliance.	
Adding a Secondary Appliance - Create an HA Clustered Pair	
If you have already run the firewall lockdown wizard on either appliance, you‚Äôll need to ensure 
that it is temporarily disabled on both appliances whilst performing the pairing process.	
1.	Deploy a second appliance that will be the Secondary and configure initial network settings.	
2.	Using the WebUI on the Primary appliance, navigate to: Cluster Configuration > High-Availability
Configuration .	
3.	Specify the IP address and the  loadbalancer user‚Äôs password for the Secondary (peer) appliance as shown in
the example above.	
¬© Copyright Loadbalancer.org ‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Ä¢ Load Balancing Kofax Equitrac 22     

4.	Click Add new node .	
5.	The pairing process now commences as shown below:	
6.	Once complete, the following will be displayed on the Primary appliance:	
7.	To finalize the configuration, restart heartbeat and any other services as prompted in the ""Commit changes"" 
message box at the top of the screen.	
Clicking the Restart Heartbeat  button on the Primary appliance will also automatically restart
heartbeat on the Secondary appliance.

Steps Required for adding an Instance	
	
‚óè	
Spinning up a couchbase exporter process for given instance to be monitored.	
	
Execute Command: $ ./couchbase-exporter --couchbase.username admin_user 

--couchbase.password --web.listen-address="":9420"" --couchbase.url=""http://235.19.xx.xx:8091""	
	

‚óè	
Adding scraping target instances in conÔ¨Åg Ô¨Åle and running the prometheus instance.	
	
‚óè

Limitations	
	

Manual Efforts required 

for new Couchbase VMs 	

that limits scalability.	
	
01	
	
03	
	
02	
	
04	
	
05	
	
06	
	

Combinations of tools not 	

being in sync when new 	

VM added.	
	

No customizations for 

Grafana & CB-Exporter 	

metrics captured.	
	

Total system failure of 

monitoring solution & 

high availability.	
	

Alerting, notifying and 

mitigation reactions for 

faulty instances.	
	

Predictive repairs  & 

outlier analysis from 

metric data streams.	
   


Automated Monitoring	
	

01	
	

ReST service architecture for adding Couchbase 

instances for monitoring	
  

   


Customizations	
	

02	
	

Add new features to Grafana dashboards, Prometheus 

database and Couchbase Exporter tool	
  


3X CUSTOMIZATIONS	
	
‚óè	
Adding new variables and graphs to observe metrics at bucket or node level.	
	
Query 1 : ""label_values(couchbase_bucket_basicstats_dataused_bytes{cluster=""$cluster""}, bucket)‚Äù	
	

Query 2 : ""label_values(couchbase_node_interestingstats_couch_spatial_data_size{cluster=""$cluster""},node)""	
	

	

‚óè	
Running Node Exporter for dynamic target analysis & AlertManager for managing alerts.	
	
‚óè	
Creating your metrics to measure with different Couchbase ReST endpoints like /indexStatus	
	
Creating Go struct object for index metric 	
‚Üí	
 Then, coding Collector object and collector function for this 	

metric as well. 	
‚Üí	
 Finally, adding index object to main.go Ô¨Åle. 	
‚Üí	
 Build the exporter with 	
go	
  build.	
	

- alert: CouchbaseNotBalanced	
	


expr: couchbase_cluster_balanced == 0 and couchbase_task_rebalance_progress == 0	
	

  	

severity: critical	
   


High Availability & 

Total Recovery	
	

03	
	

Prometheus runs as standalone instance on a VM.	
	

Red Flag:	
 What if that VM goes down or needs rebooting? 	
	

  


High Availability for Monitoring Solution	
	

HIGH AVAILABILITY 	
	

CB-Exporter service 	

duplicates request to both 	

servers.	
	

	

Both servers when live 	

maintains same 

targets.json Ô¨Åle.	
	

‚óè	
CB-Exporter Recovery: Initiating CB-Exporter after Couchbase VM patching or Reboot.	
	

‚óè	
Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter and AlertManager Recovery: Initiating service after the reboot 

and starting the two ReST HTTP servers as well.	
	

Total Recovery Initiation	
    


Predictive Maintenance 	
	

04	
	

Analyzing stream of system health data Couchbase Instance	
	

& taking predictive actions with outlier analytics	
  


Predictive Maintenance from data streams	
	
‚óè	
Unsupervised outlier detection analysis with 	
PyOD	
 on forecasted data with 	
fbprophet.	
	
Step 1:	
 Forecasting for CPU%, Request 	

Counts, Network and DB consumption 

metrics.	
	

Couchbase VM	
	
Step 3:	
 Sanity Checks on model 	

predictions and deployment 

performance..	
	

75-25 Split	
	
h	
pred	
 = 1 day	
	
Step 2:	
 MAE evaluation 	

for forecast model 

performance analysis.	
	

Exporting Prometheus Data	
	

HTTP server scraping data with ReST 

API: /query resource endpoint. Beware, 	

not to overload !! 	
 
	

Modelling Techniques	
	

Forecasting: Additive models for each

Migrating	 Relational	 Models	 to	 NoSQL	 Models	
You	 can	 convert	 and	 migrate	 your	 relational	 models	 to	 NoSQL	 models	 in	 two	 ways:	
Changing	 the	 target	 database	
Deriving	 a model	
This	 topic	 walks	 you	 through	 the	 steps	 to	 migrate	 a SQL	 Server	 model	 to	 a MongoDB	 model.	 	
Similarly,	 you	 can	 migrate	 your	 relational	 models	 to	 Cassandra	 and	 Couchbase	 models.	
Note	: Ensure	 that	 you	 keep	 a backup	 of	 your	 original	 models.	
Migration	 by	 Changing	 the	 Target	 Database	
To	 migrate	 by	 changing	 the	 target	 database,	 follow	 these	 steps:	
 1.	 Open	 your	 relational	 model	 in	 erwin	 Data	 Modeler	 (DM).	
Note	: Ensure	 that	 you	 are	 in	 the	 Physical	 mode.	
For	 example,	 the	 following	 image	 uses	 the	 sample	 eMovies.erwin	 model.	 In	 the	 	
Objects	 Count	 pane,	 note	 the	 number	 of	 tables,	 columns,	 and	 relationships. 

	
15	
 2.	 On	 the	 ribbon,	 click	 Actions	 > Target	 Database	 or	 on	 the	 status	 bar,	 click	 the	 database	 	
name.
The	 erwin	 Data	 Modeler	 -- Target	 Server	 screen	 appears.	
 3.	 In	 the	 Database	 drop-	down	 list,	 select	 MongoDB.	
By	 default,	 the	 Auto	 Denormalization	 check	 box	 is selected.	 Keep	 it selected.	
 4.	 Click	 OK	.	
The	 conversion	 process	 starts. 

	
16	
Once	 the	 conversion	 is complete,	 the	 existing	 model	 in	 migrated	 to	 a NoSQL database.	
In	 the	 Objects	 Count	 pane,	 note	 that	 instead	 of	 tables	 and	 columns,	 we	 now	 have	 col	-	
lections	 and	 fields.	 Also,	 the	 Relationships	 count	 has	 changed	 to	 0.	 The	 migration	 pro	-	
cess	 converts	 and	 merges	 multiple	 tables,	 columns,	 and	 relationships	 to	 the	 NoSQL	 	
format	 according	 to	 the	 database	 that	 you	 select.	                  	
Note	: This	 migration	 method	 overwrites	 the	 existing	 model	 once	 you	 save	 it.	 Hence,	 	
we	 recommend	 that	 you	 keep	 a backup	 of	 your	 original	 model.	
Migration	 by	 Deriving	 a	 Model	
To	 migrate	 by	 deriving	 a model,	 follow	 these	 steps: 

	
17	
 1.	 Open	 your	 relational	 model	 in	 erwin	 Data	 Modeler	 (DM).	
Note	: Ensure	 that	 you	 are	 in	 the	 Physical	 mode.	
For	 example,	 the	 following	 image	 uses	 the	 sample	 eMovies.erwin	 model.	 In	 the	 	
Objects	 Count	 pane,	 note	 the	 number	 of	 tables,	 columns,	 and	 relationships.	
 2.	 On	 the	  ribbon,	  click	 Actions	 > Design	 Layers	 > Derive	 New	 Model	.	
The	 Derive	 Model	 screen	 appears.	 By	 default,	 the	 Source	 Model	 is set	 to	 your	 current	 	
model.

 5.	 Select	 the	 types	 of	 objects	 that	 you	 want	 to	 derive	 into	 the	 target	 MongoDB	 model.	
 6.	 Click	 Next	.	
The	 Object	 Selection	 section	 appears.	 Based	 on	 the	 object	 types	 you	 selected	 in	 step	 	
5,	 it displays	 a list	 of	 objects. 

	
21	
 7.	 Select	 the	 objects	 that	 you	 want	 to	 derive	 into	 the	 target	 MongoDB	 model.	
 8.	 Click	 Derive	.	
The	 model	 derivation	 process	 starts. 

	
22	
Once	 the	 conversion	 is complete,	 the	 existing	 model	 in	 migrated	 to	 a NoSQL database.	
In	 the	 Objects	 Count	 pane,	 note	 that	 instead	 of	 tables	 and	 columns,	 we	 now	 have	 col	-	
lections	 and	 fields.	 Also,	 the	 Relationships	 count	 has	 changed	 to	 0.	 The	 migration	 pro	-	
cess	 converts	 and	 merges	 multiple	 tables,	 columns,	 and	 relationships	 to	 the	 NoSQL	 	
format	 according	 to	 the	 database	 that	 you	 select.	  

	
23

provides	 brief	 descriptions	 of	 the	 controls	 on	 each	 dialog	 box	 and	 tab,	 which	 you	 can	 	
use	 as	 a point	 of	 reference	 while	 working	 with	 database	 design	 features.	
As	 a best	 practice,	 use	 the	 MySQL	 ANSI	 ODBC	 driver	 for	 Reverse	 Engineering	 from	 	
Database	 (REDB)	 while	 using	 erwin¬Æ	 Data	 Modeler 

	
74	
Data	 Vault	 2.0	 Support	
erwin	 Data	 Modeler	 (DM)	 now	 Data	 Vault	 2.0	 as	 a modeling	 technique	 across	 all	 target	 data	-	
bases.	 This	 implementation	 supports	 the	 following	 Data	 Vault	 2.0	 components	 by	 default	 	
through	 API:	
Hub
Link
Satellite
Reference
PIT
Bridge	
These	 components	 are	 available	 on	 Home	 tab	 of	 the	 ribbon.	
To	 enable	 Data	 Vault	 2.0	 on	 your	 model,	 follow	 these	 steps:	
 1.	 Right-	click	 the	 model	 and	 click	 Properties	.	
 2.	 On	 the	 Model	 Editor	 > General	 tab,	 select	 the	 Data	 Vault	 2.0	 check	 box. 

	
75	
Once	 enabled,	 Data	 Vault	 2.0	 components	 are	 available	 via	 the	 Model	 Explorer.	 You	 	
can	 now	 convert	 your	 model	 to	 a Data	 Vault	 model	.	
You	 can	 also	 create	 custom	 components	 and	 apply	 them	 to	 tables.	 However,	 these	 	
custom	 components	 do	 not	 appear	 on	 the	 ribbon. 

	
76	
Productivity	 and	 UI	 Enhancements	
Several	 additions	 and	 enhancements	 have	 been	 implemented	 to	 improve	 erwin	 Data	 	
Modeler's	 (DM)	 productivity	 and	 usage	 experience.	 These	 enhancements	 are:	
Welcome	 Page	
Objects	 Count	 Pane	
Properties	 Pane	
Object	 Browser	
Normalization	 and	 Denormalization	
Reverse	 Engineering	 and	 Forward	 Engineering	 Wizard	 Redesign	
Improved	 Speed	 Mode	
Welcome	 Page	
The	 Welcome	 page	 is a starter	 page	 that	 helps	 new	 users	 to	 get	 started	 with	 erwin	 DM.	 It 	
appears	 when	 you	 launch	 erwin	 DM	 and	 is also	 accessible	 via	 Help	 > Welcome	. It contains	 	
shortcuts	 to	 key	 actions	 that	 are	 performed	 frequently,	 such	 as	 opening	 models	 or	 creating	 	
new	 ones,	 running	 reverse	 engineering	 or	 complete	 compare	 wizards,	 and	 connecting	 to	 the	 	
Mart.	 Apart	 from	 these,	 the	 Welcome	 page	 provides	 access	 to	 recently	 used	 files,	  erwin	 DM	 	
Tools,	 Technical	 Support,	 and	 Help	 links. 

	
77 

	
78	
Objects	 Count	 Pane	
As	 data	 models	 become	 complex	 and	 large,	 it becomes	 necessary	 to	 get	 a snapshot	 of	 the	 	
objects	 within	 models.	 To	 facilitate	 this,	 erwin	 DM	 now	 includes	 an	 Objects	 Count	 pane.	 This	 	
pane	 displays	 information	 about	 a selected	 model	 and	 a count	 of	 all	 the	 objects	 present	 in	 	
it.	 Also,	 it displays	 a snapshot	 of	 this	 information	 in	 the	 pictorial	 format,	 which	 you	 can	 cus	-	
tomize	 using	 the	 Style	 and	 Pallete	 options.	 By	 default,	 this	 pane	 opens	 on	 the	 right-	side	 of	 	
the	 application.	 You	 can	 also	 access	 it via	 View	 > Panes	 > Objects	 Count	 Pane	.	
Properties	 Pane	
While	 working	 on	 data	 models,	 accessing	 the	 property	 editors	 to	 view	 or	 edit	 the	 model	 and	 	
its	 object's	 properties	 can	 get	 tedious	 and	 slow	 you	 down.	 To	 address	 this,	 erwin	 DM	 now	 	
includes	 a Properties	 pane.	 This	 pane	 enables	 you	 to	 view	 and	 edit	 the	 selected	 object's	 	
properties	 along	 with	 the	 model	 diagram,	 side-	by-	side.	 By	 default,	 this	 pane	 opens	 on	 the	  

	
79	
right-	side	 of	 the	 application.	 You	 can	 also	 access	 it via	 View	 > Panes	 > Properties	 Pane	 on	 	
the	 ribbon.	
Object	 Browser	
The	 Object	 Browser	 is a one-	stop	 location	 where	 you	 can	 view	 tables,	 views,	 materialized	 	
views,	 indexes,	 relationships,	 and	 the	 complete	 model's	 or	 specific	 table's	 DDL.	 You	 can	 	
export	 this	 information	 as	 a report	 in	 CSV,	 HTML,	 or	 PDF formats.	 To	 access	 the	 Object	 	
Browser,	 on	 the	 Properties	 pane,	 click	 	 or	 on	 the	 ribbon,	 click	 Tools	 > Object	 Browser	. 	
For	 more	 information,	 refer	 to	 the	 Object	 Browser	 topic. 

	
80	
Normalization	 and	 Denormalization	
The	 Normalization	 and	 Denormalization	 features	 enable	 you	 to	 define	 relationships	 in	 a 	
NoSQL	 model.	 Normalization	 splits	 the	 fields	 in	 a collection	 into	 multiple	 collections	 based	 	
on	 the	 selected	 relationship	 type.	 Whereas	 Denormalization	 embeds	 multiple	 collections	 	
into	 a single	 collection	 based	 on	 the	 selected	 embedding	 type.	 To	 access	 these	 features,	 on	 	
the	 ribbon,	 click	 Actions	. Then,	 click	 Normalization	 or	 Denormalization	. For	 more	 inform	-	
ation,	 refer	 to	 the	 Defining	 Relationships	 Using	 Embedding	 Method	 topic. 

	
81	
Reverse	 Engineering	 and	 Forward	 Engineering	 Wizard	 Redesign	
The	 Reverse	 Engineering	 and	 Forward	 Engineering	 wizards	 have	 been	 redesigned	 for	 better	 	
arrangement	 of	 properties	 and	 ease	 of	 use.	 For	 more	 information,	 refer	 to	 the	 Reverse	 	
Engineering	 and	 Forward	 Engineering	 topics. 

	
82 

	
83	
Improved	 Speed	 Mode	
The	 Load	 Diagram	 with	 speed	 mode	 option	 now	 provides	 another	 option,	 Load	 Diagram	 	
with	 entity/table	 view.	 This	 option	 improves	 the	 model	 load	 performance	 in	 case	 of	 large	 	
models	 significantly.	 It does	 so	 by	  rendering	 the	 model	 in	 the	 simplest	 way	 possible,	 with	 	
only	 the	 entities	 or	 tables,	 and	 their	 relationships.	 Also,	 by	 default,	 it disables	 the	 PK-	FK	 high	-	
light	 feature	 (Display	 Diagram	 Highlight	 option	 on	 Model	 Editor).	
This	 option	 is available	 on	 Tools	 > Options	 dialog	 box. 

	
84	
  

	
85	
JDBC	 Support	
erwin	 DM	 now	 includes	 JDBC	 support	 for	 the	 following	 databases:	
Oracle
SQL	 Server	
Azure	 SQL

Non,"Digital Technology Permanent Salary 	
Guide for Bristol & Bath 

Within the Tech sector, salaries are never stagnant, 
trends are consistently on the up. Year on year, 
there‚Äôs always an increasing demand for talent, 
with the levels of experience remaining the same.
With more of a push for businesses to become 
digitally focused in order to keep up with market 
competition, the number of available candidates 	
doesn‚Äôt quite correlate. 

At ADLIB, we‚Äôre always keeping close to market trends and how things can 	
fluctuate between start-ups, scale-ups, agencies, software houses, 	
larger organisations and corporates. 	
Here, we aim to provide an overall range of salaries based on a variety of roles. The following rates are 
based on our work with digital agencies, software houses and SMEs, rather than large enterprises or 	
corporations.	
Note: There are always factors to consider when assigning a salary to a role, such as the skill demand, the 
complexity of the technology, how popular it is in the market, level of responsibility as well as what other 	
benefits are on offer, such as remote working. 	
It‚Äôs also worth noting that the ‚Äònumber of years‚Äô of experience is not an ideal measure of technical 	
proficiency. However, as a general guide, it should provide some ballparks and pointers...

technological  development,  and  introduction  of 
information  and  communication  technologies  (ICT) 
in most areas of human activity. ¬†This trend has led to 
an  increase  in  demand  for  IT  specialists  [1],  in 
particular  software  engineers. ¬†This  profession  has 
recently  become  one  of  the  most  prestigious  and 
highly paid ones [2].¬† Moreover, knowledge of IT and 
programming  skills  are  part  of  digital  competence 
which  has  now  become  a  key  competence  for  all 
people [3].  The  demand  for  IT  specialists  in  the  labor  market, 
variety  of  programming  languages  and  software 
actualize  the  need  for  specialist  training.  Depending 
on  the  specialization,  IT  specialists  must  be  able  to 
develop  different  types  of  software,  work  with 
databases,  administer  operating  systems  and 
networks  [4],  provide  information  security,  process 
graphic  files,  create  video  and  3D  models,  etc.  Since 
the  technological  development  of  society  is  ongoing, 
IT  specialists  must  constantly  improve  their  skills 
and meet the requirements of the time.  IT specialist training is a complex and multifaceted 
task.  It  is  solved  through  theoretical  and  practical 
training  in  various  areas  [5],  focus  on  the  most 
popular  programming  languages  [6],  practical 
orientation  of  the  knowle dge  acquired.  Student-
centered  learning  and  specifics  of  the  subject  area 
have  influenced  the  methods  and  teaching  aids  used 
to  train  future  programmers.  The  effective  means  are 
the  immediate  assessment  of  the  program  code  in 
automatic mode [7], the use o f analytical projects [2], 
combination  of  related  disciplines  for  the  integrated 
development of professional competencies [4].  The introduction of ICT in the educational process 
allows  us  to  diversify  the  process  of  future  specialist 
training  and  to  increase  its  efficiency.  In  order  to 
train  future  software  engineers,  as  well  as  anyone 
interested,  various  software  solutions  can  be  used: 
distance  learning  systems  [3],  educational

programming resources [8], and massive open online 
courses (MOOC). 
Recently,  MOOC  have  become  quite  popular  due 
to  their  availability  and  massive-scale  nature.  The 
effectiveness  of  MOOC  to  study  programming  has 
been  proved  by  courses  on  various  programming 
languages,  such  as  Java  [9],  [10],  Visual  Basic  [11], 
Haskell  [12]  and  more.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a 
need  for  a  more  detailed  quantitative  analysis  of 
available  programming  courses  on  various  online 
platforms.¬†¬†
 
2. Background Research 
 
2.1. IT Specialist Training in the Field of 
Programming  
 
In  the  conditions  when  information  society  is 
rapidly  developing,  one  can  notice  constant 
development  of  new  software  and  hardware,  as  well 
as  updating  and  modification  of  the  existing  ones.  It 
is  especially  true  for  training  future  computer 
specialists  who  work  directly  with  software  and 
hardware.  As  a  result,  the  requirements  for  the  IT 
specialist  training  are  constantly  modified  and 
supplemented. 
Usually, software development is the responsibility 
of  software  engineers.  They  must  be  familiar  with 
modern  technologies  and  methods  of  processing, 
storage,  protection,  transmission  of  information  [13], 
they must know modern programming languages and 
integrated  development  environments  (IDE);  they 
must  be  able  to  apply  the  acquired  knowledge  and 
skills  to  develop  computer  programs.  One  of  the 
main  requirements  on  the  part  of  employers  is 
knowledge  of  a  specific  language  /  environment  / 
programming  technology  or  a  certain  list  of  these 
components. The acquired experience and knowledge 
of  specific  software  will  increase  programmers‚Äô 
productivity  in  the  process  of  professional  activity 
[1];  it  will  reduce  the  time  and  financial  costs  for 
their retraining. 
Training  of  computer  specialists,  including  future 
software engineers, has its own characteristics due to 
the  availability  of  courses  on  software  development 
and  ICT  use.  Each  programming  language  uses  a 
certain programming technology (procedural, logical, 
functional,  OOP);  it  has  its  own  syntax  which  helps 
to implement the task that is set before the 
programmer  [10].  This  is  especially  true  of  the 
syntax  of  different  programming  languages,  such  as 
C++,  Pascal,  Basic.  At  the  same  time,  programmers 
must  have  the  ability  to  create  algorithm,  divide  the 
problem into several logical and consistent subtasks.  
In  addition  to  professional  competencies,  it  is 
necessary  for  modern  IT  specialists  to  have  well-
developed  soft  skills.  In  particular,  it  is  the  ability  to work  in  a  team  and  perform  project  activities,  the 
ability  to  analyze  and  synthesize  the  information 
obtained,  independence,  the  ability  to  find  necessary 
information  in  various  sources.  Now  we  can  observe 
a  trend  when  software  development  projects  are  not 
performed  independently  by  only  one  programmer, 
but they appear as a result  of teamwork. At the same 
time,  project  participants  may  be  from  different 
countries  working  outsourced.  Therefore,  well-
developed communication skills [2], as well as social 
competence  [14]  are  of  particular  importance  for 
future  IT  specialists.  They  help  to  communicate 
effectively  through  social  networks,  instant 
messaging programs and more. 
English  is  also  highly  important  for  software 
engineers.  It  is  explained  by  the  English  syntax  of 
programming  languages  which  allow  you  to 
practically  implement  the  algorithm  using  words  and 
constructions  which  are  intuitively  understood.  The 
work  [15]  identified  a  system  of  English-language 
training for future software engineers which involves 
the  use  of  active  teaching  methods.  In  the  process  of 
communicative  training,  future  IT  specialists  can 
form  various  communication  strategies,  as  well  as  a 
glossary of IT and programming terminology. 
Similar  to  any  specialty,  IT  specialist  training 
depends  on  the  demand  in  the  labor  market, 
employers‚Äô  requirements  for  future  professionals  [6]. 
Comprehensive  theoretical  and  practical  professional 
training,  as  well  as  formation  of  soft  skills,  can  be 
obtained  at  a  higher  education  institution.  Moreover, 
training of future software engineers should be based 
on a competency-based approach, modern techniques 
and  technological  achievements.  Only  in  this  case, 
the  IT  specialist  will  be  competitive.  In  this  context 
the  work  [5]  indicates  the  main  points  aimed  at 
quality  training  of  future  software  engineers: 
systematic  review  and  updating  of  educational 
programs,  taking  into  account  the  requirements  of 
employers  and  other  participants  of  the  educational 
process;  obtaining  current  and  final  information  on 
student  performance,  making  appropriate 
adjustments;  improving  the  quality  of  teaching; 
providing  students‚Äô  practical  training  in  real 
conditions  at  enterprises;  advanced  training  of 
teachers;  providing  educational  process  with  the 
necessary  methodological,  technological  and  other 
support. 
Usually,  training  of  a  future  specialist  in  computer 
science  involves  mastering  professional  disciplines, 
performing  term  papers,  academic  and  on-the-job 
practices.  At  the  end of  the  training,  students  have  to 
defend their qualification work (project) and / or take 
the  state  final  exam.  These  forms  of  state 
certification  allow  you  to  check  the  formation  of 
professional  and  general  competencies  in  accordance 
with the chosen specialty.

Today,  higher  education  institutions  pay  great 
attention  to  digitalization  of  the  educational  process. 
For  this  purpose,  they  use  information  environments 
to  manage  the  educational  process  [16],  as  well  as 
virtual  social  networks  [17],  augmented  reality 
technologies  [18],  various  electronic  educational 
resources. The Learning Management System (LMS) 
and  MOOC  have  proven  themselves  well  for  the 
professional  training  of  future  software  engineers. 
Moreover, the correct selection of online courses will 
provide  effective  training  for  students  with  different 
levels of training [7], [12].¬†¬†

2.2. Specific Features of Online Programming 
Courses 
 
MOOC is a modern electronic educational resource 
which  supports  the  principles  of  massive-scale  and 
open  education  which  is  based  on  network 
technologies  and  which  allows  you  to  learn 
independently  and  improve  your  skills.  Compared  to 
the  LMS,  which  are  designed  to  organize  distance 
learning,  they  have  more educational  opportunities 
and  are  not  tied  to  a  specific  educational  institution. 
The advantages of the MOOC include: 
 
ÔÇß availability  of  a  large  number  of  online  courses 
on various topics [19]; 
ÔÇß support for multilingual interface; 
ÔÇß flexibility  and  individual  working  mode  with 
educational material; 
ÔÇß the  opportunity  to  join  the  courses  created  by 
teachers of leading educational institutions [9]; 
ÔÇß availability  of  multimedia  and  interactive  tools 
that allow students and teachers to work together 
[10]; 
ÔÇß the  opportunity  to  obtain  a  certificate  after 
successful completion of the course. 	
 
Most  MOOC  are  characterized  by  elements  of  the 
traditional  education  system,  including  lecture 
material, standardized control in the form of answers 
to  testing  tasks.  They  use  objectivist-individual 
approach  in  learning  which  involves  independent 
processing  of  information  and  high  motivation  to 
learn  [20].  In  addition,  capabilities  of  Web  2.0  allow 
you  to  integrate  video  lectures,  quizzes,  surveys, 
graphic  representation  of  the  course  dynamics, 
feedback, etc. into the MOOC. 
Online  programming  courses  can  be  studied  by 
different categories of students: 
 
ÔÇß students  who  additionally  receive  information 
within a similar discipline; 
ÔÇß IT  specialists  who  want  to  learn  a  new 
technology or programming language; 
ÔÇß teachers who want to get acquainted with leading 
teaching practices and technologies; 
ÔÇß any users who are interested in programming. The  specific  features  of  online  programming 
courses  are  explained  by  the  specifics  of  software 
engineers‚Äô  work,  the  need  to  form  students‚Äô  abstract 
and  logical  thinking,  glossary  of  computing  terms 
[11].  Knowledge  of  the  syntax  of  specific 
programming  languages,  the  principles  of  work  with 
tool  and  application  software  is  important  in  the 
study  of  programming.  It  is  very  good  when  online 
programming  courses  contain  educational  videos, 
examples  of  program  code  with  an  explanation  of  its 
work logic. In this case, students will be able to use it 
for producing software products in the future. 
Similar  to  the  content  of  any  programming 
discipline,  online  courses  should  focus  on  the 
practical application of the knowledge acquired. As a 
result,  they  should  include  exercises  for  creating 
algorithms,  programs  or  individual  program  blocks. 
The effectiveness of such online courses is proved by 
[10],  [12].  In  addition,  there  are  corresponding  voice 
agents  [9]  to  provide  interactivity  and  effective 
feedback for some online platforms. 
One  of  the  problematic  issues  to  consider  when 
studying  programming  with  MOOC  is  the  lack  of 
direct  contact  with  the  teacher  [12].  Due  to  the  low 
level  of  understanding  of  the  learning  material,  the 
high  level  of  algorithmization  and  abstraction  of 
certain  topics,  some  novice  programmers  cannot 
complete the course on their own [9]. In this case, the 
teacher  acts  as  an  instructor  who  can  explain  the 
logic  of  the  program  code,  who  can  advise  on 
additional  sources  of  information  and  show  another 
solution to the problem, etc. On the other hand, some 
teachers  have  a  low  level  of  motivation  and  digital 
preparation  for  the  use  of  MOOC  in  the  educational 
process. 
In  today‚Äôs  pandemic  environment  when  it  is 
impossible  to  fully  conduct  face-to-face  training, 
MOOC  can  be  used  effectively  in  blended  learning 
[21].  In  this  case,  learning  materials,  which  are 
offered  to  students  within  the  discipline,  are 
supplemented  with  information  from  online  courses. 
The  basic  learning  material  can  be  located  in  the 
LMS to ensure that all participants of the educational 
process  registered  in  the  system  can  get  access  to  it. 
This  form  of  the  educational  process  organization 
will help to avoid certain shortcomings of the MOOC 
and improve the quality of learning. 
 
3. Methodology 
 
For  the  quantitative  analysis  of  online 
programming  courses,  we  analyzed  six  MOOC 
(Alison,  Udemy,  Edx,  Coursera,  Udacity, 
Codecademy)  as  of  July  2021.  Two  methods  were 
chosen  to  form  the  sample:  a)  search  of  online 
courses  in  thematic  rubricators  (catalogues  that 
contain  online  courses  on  a  particular  topic);  b)  

TEM¬†Journal.¬†Volume¬†10,¬†Issue¬†4,¬†Pages¬†1884‚Äê1894,¬†ISSN¬†2217‚Äê8309,¬†DOI:¬†10.18421/TEM104‚Äê52,¬†November¬†2021.¬†

automatic  search  of  online  courses  (names  of 
programming languages were used as keywords). 
The Alison online platform contains 160 courses in 
the  thematic  block  ‚ÄúIT‚Äù‚Äì‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù.  Of  these, 
50  courses  are  designed  to  study  programming 
languages and they have different levels of difficulty. 
Automatic  search  allowed  us  to  find  79  online 
programming  courses.  With  this  method  it  was  not 
possible  to  count  the  number  of  online  courses  to 
study  C,  C++,  C#.  This  is  due  to  the  inclusion  of 
these  symbols  in  the  names  of  non-programming 
courses.  All  courses  are  free  and  certified  by  the 
independent  organization Continuing  Professional 
Development.  It  confirms  the  high  level  of 
educational  content  which  is  presented  in  the  online 
courses on this platform. 
On  the  online  platform  Udemy,  there  are  6,759 
courses  to  learn  programming  languages.  They  can 
be  found  in  the  thematic  block  ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù‚Äì
‚ÄúProgramming  languages‚Äù.  Through  this  search  you 
can  find  courses  on  9  programming  languages. 
Automatic  search  allowed  us  to  find  93,428  online 
courses on 16 programming languages. 
The  Edx  online  platform  contains  53  courses  on 
programming  languages.  They  can  be  found  in  such 
sections  as  ‚ÄúComputer  Science‚Äù  and  ‚ÄúDataAnalisys 
&  Statistics‚Äù.  The  sample  of  online  courses  which 
was  found  by  automatic  keyword  search  included 
1,317  courses.  This  method  did  not  let  us  count  the 
number  of  online  courses  in  the  C,  C++,  and  R 
programming languages due to the inclusion of these 
characters in the names of non-programming courses. 
The  analysis  of  programming  languages  on  the 
Coursera  platform  was  carried  out  in  the  section 
‚ÄúComputer  science‚Äù  by  means  of  automatic  keyword 
search.  Searching  with  subject  headings 
demonstrated  ambiguous  results,  so  they  were  not 
taken  into  account.  The  names  of  the  programming 
languages  were  used  as  keywords  in  the  automatic 
search.  This  resource  allows  you  to  view  3,623 
online  programming  courses.  Due  to  the 
coincidences in the course names, it was not possible 
to  perform  an  automatic  search  of  the  C  and  Go 
programming languages. 
On the Codecademy platform, the sample of online 
courses for the quantitative analysis was made on the 
basis of the ‚ÄúLanguages‚Äù section. There you can find 
12  programming  languages  with  two  levels  of 
difficulty  (‚ÄúBeginner  friendly  courses‚Äù  and 
‚ÄúIntermediate  courses‚Äù).  The  total  number  of  online 
programming  courses  was  117.  Using  automatic 
search  by  programming  language  names,  we 
managed  to  find  only  59  online  courses  on  the 
Codecademy platform. 
On the Udacity platform, the formation of a sample 
of  online  programming  courses  was  made  on  the 
basis of the ‚ÄúProgramming & Development‚Äù section. The total number of online courses on the platform is 
8 courses, so their number was not taken into account 
in  the  quantitative  analysis.  For  our  study,  the 
Udacity  platform  was  useful  for  its  specific  features 
(availability  of  syllabuses  and  reviews  of  online 
courses). 
 
4. Result 	
 
On  the  Alison  platform,  you  can  improve  your 
qualification  in  different  directions:  IT,  healthy 
lifestyle,  business,  marketing,  personal  development, 
education  and  science.  Learning  on  the  platform  is 
free.  However,  the  certificate  is  payable.  There  is  a 
system  of  discounts  (from  10%)  for  different 
categories of users. The thematic block ‚ÄúIT‚Äù contains 
courses  that  allow  users  to  learn  about  data  safety, 
computer  networks,  information  systems, 
engineering, programming, etc. In the thematic block 
‚ÄúIT‚Äù‚Äì‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù  users  can  learn  nine 
programming languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, –°, 
C++,  Perl,  C#,  Swift,  Ruby.  Apart  from  thematic 
sections,  the  user  can  try  an  automatic  keyword 
search of online courses. In addition, you can specify 
the  selection  criteria  and  choose  duration  (in  hours), 
the  type  (certificate  or  diploma),  level  (beginner, 
intermediate, advanced), etc. The summarized data as 
for the number of online programming courses on the 
Alison platform are shown in Table 1.

According  to  the  presented  data  (see  Table  1.), 
with the help of the rubricator, the user can access up 
to  50  online  programming  courses.  The  smallest 
number  of  courses  is  devoted  to  such  programming 
languages  as  Perl,  Swift,  Ruby.  They  are  represented 
by  2  (4%)  courses  each.  The  most  popular 
programming  languages  are  Python  and  C++  which 
have 12 (24%) online courses each. 
The  sample,  which  was  formed  by  an  automatic 
search, includes 79 online programming courses. The 
least  popular  turned  out  to  be  the  Perl  programming 
language  (2  courses,  2.5%).  The  largest  number  of

online  courses  is  intended  for  learning  the  Python 
language  (40  courses,  50.6%  of  the  total  number  of 
online courses found with the automatic search). 
On the Udemy platform, the thematic block 
‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù‚Äì‚ÄúProgramming  languages‚Äù  contains 
online  courses  on  Python,  Java,  C#,  React,  C++, 
JavaScript,  C,  Spring,  Go.  Using  the  automatic 
search  function  for  a  specific  programming  language 
gives  users  a  possibility  to  get  more  information 
about  available  online  courses.  With  the  help  of  the 
rubricator,  seven  more  programming  languages  are 
added  to  the  previously  found  programming 
languages, namely: Go, Kotlin, PHP, Swift, R, Ruby, 
Scala,  Scratch.  Quantitative  indicators  of  online 
courses  found  on  the  Udemy  platform  are  shown  in

Comparison  of  the  obtained  data  (see  Table  2.) 
allows  us  to  draw  a  conclusion  about  the  significant 
difference  in  the  number  of  online  courses  found 
with  the  use  of  different  methods.  The  section 
‚ÄúProgramming  languages‚Äù  contains  6,759  online 
courses on 9 programming languages. Most of online 
courses  deal  with  such  programming  languages  as 
Python  (2,372  courses,  35.1%  of  the  total  number  of 
online  courses  in  the  ‚ÄúProgramming  languages‚Äù 
section)  and  JavaScript  (1,125  courses,  16.6%).  The 
smallest  number  of  courses  in  the  section  deals  with 
the Go language (126 courses, 1.9%). 
In  its  turn,  the  automatic  search  allows  you  to  see 
93,428 online courses on 16 programming languages. 
Searching for courses in automatic mode let us find 5 
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C, 
Go)  which  have  the  maximum  number  of  courses 
(more  than  10,000).  The  smallest  sample  of  online 	
courses  deals  with  the  Scala  programming  language 
(541 courses). 
To  search  for  online  programming  courses  on  the 
Edx  platform,  you  should  go  to  the  categories 
‚ÄúComputer  Science‚Äù  and  ‚ÄúDataAnalisys  & 
Statistics‚Äù.  According  to  these  categories,  6 
programming  languages  were  identified  (Python, 
Java,  C,  C++,  Swift,  R).  You  can  review  all  the 
presented  courses  and  clarify  the  following  aspects: 
course  duration,  weekly  workload  for  learning  the 
programming  language,  the  cost  of  the  course  and 
certificate,  educational  institution  presenting  the 
course,  subject  to  which  the  course  belongs,  level  of 
difficulty, language and type of the course. 
Using  automatic  search  you  can  see  more  online 
programming  courses  compared  to  the  rubricator 
search.  Additionally,  courses  on  React,  JavaScript, 
PHP,  Ruby,  Scratch,  PyTorch,  Arduino  become 
available.  The  obtained  quantitative  indicators  are 
shown in Table 3.

Having analyzed the results of the tabular data (see 	
Table 3.) we can state that according to the rubricator 
the  smallest  number  of  courses  is  devoted  to  the 
Swift  programming  language  (1  course,  1.9%  of  the 
total  number  of  courses  in  rubricators)  and  C++  (2 
courses,  3.7%).  The  most  popular  language  appeared 
to  be  Python,  27  online  courses  were  developed  to 
learn  it  (50.9%  of  the  total  number  of  courses  found 
with  the  use  of  the  rubricator).  The  second  place  in 
the  number  of  online  courses  is  taken  by  the  C 
language (13 courses, 24.5%). 	
The  analysis  of  the  courses  received  by  means  of 	
the automatic search allowed us to show much higher 
indicators.  Using  this  method  we  managed  to  find 
1,317 programming courses. We found that when we 
automatically  search  for  a  specific  programming 
language,  the  system  reproduces  the  sample  not  only

by  the  name,  but  it  also  takes  into  account  the 
internal  structure  and  content  of  the  course.  The 
course  title  does  not  always  contain  programming 
languages,  so  it  is  difficult  to  understand  what  the 
course  includes.  The  most  popular  language  on  the 
Edx  platform  appeared  to  be  Java  with  583  online 
courses  (44.2%  of  the  total  number  of  programming 
courses  found  with  automatic  search).  The  least 
number  of  online  courses  deals  with  PyTorch  (4 
courses) and PHP (6 courses). 	
If  users  want  to  learn  programming  with  the 	
Coursera  platform,  they  should  focus  on  the 
‚ÄúComputer  Science‚Äù  section.  It  contains  5 
subcategories  ‚ÄúSoftware-development‚Äù,  ‚ÄúMobile  and 
web  development‚Äù,  etc.  Each  subcategory  presents 
the  most  popular  topics,  including  programming 
languages.  However,  the  list  of  programming 
languages  is  missing.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to 
correlate  programming  languages  with  particular 
thematic sections.  	
The  Coursera  platform  has  a  developed  function 	
for  a  keyword  search  of  online  courses.  To  simplify 
the  search,  you  can  filter  courses  by  the  following 
criteria:  language,  level,  duration,  topic,  skills, 
collaboration, and learning product. The summarized 
data on the number of online courses on the Coursera 
platform is shown in Table 4.

As  we  can  see  from  Table  4.,  the  Coursera 
platform  mostly  deals  with  Java  (1,427  courses, 
39.4%  of  the  total  number  of  online  programming 
courses)  and  Python  (938  courses,  25.9%).  The  least 
number  of  the  courses  on  the  platform  deals  with 
Arduino  (18  courses,  0.5%)  and  PyTorch  (27 
courses,  7.4%).  Since  Arduino  is  promising  for 
robotics,  we  hope  that  the  number  of  courses  on  this 
programming  language  will  increase  significantly  in 
the  future.  Most  courses  are  free.  However,  the 
certificate must be paid for. 
The  online  platform  Codecademy  contains 
programming  courses  in  the  section  ‚ÄúCatalog‚Äù  ‚Äì 
‚ÄúLanguages‚Äù.  There  are 12  programming  languages 
(HTML,  CSS,  Python,  JavaScript,  Java,  etc.). 
Courses  are  designed  for  two  levels  of  training 
(Beginner  and  Intermediate).  Also,  keyword  search 
of  online  courses  is  available  for  users.  The  obtained

According  to  the  data  obtained,  117  online 
programming  courses  are  available  for  the  future 
programmer.  Most  of  the  online  courses  in  the 
‚ÄúLanguages‚Äù  deal  with  the  Python  language  (38 
courses, 32.56% of the total number of programming 
courses).  JavaScript  (34  courses,  29%)  takes  the 
second  place  in  the  number  of  online  courses.  There 
is  only  one  course  for  the  C++,  PHP,  Go,  Kotlin 
programming languages. 
With  the  help  of  automatic  online  search,  the 
platform displays only 59 online courses. Analysis of 
the  number  of  courses  obtained  through  different 
methods  revealed  a  discrepancy  of  58  courses.  The 
most popular programming languages appeared to be 
HTML & CSS, Python, JavaScript, Java; there are 10 
courses for each one of them. 
Some of the considered online courses are partially 
paid.  There  are  courses  where  only  a  few  classes  are 
paid and the course itself is free. For students there is 
a  system  of  discounts  on  the  cost  of  courses  (up  to 
35%).  However,  such  a  discount  is  active  after 
confirmation  of  the  student  status  and  is  valid  for  no 
more than 4 years. To receive bonuses in the form of 
a  reduced  cost  for  an  online  course,  you  must 
annually confirm your student status. 
On the Udacity platform, you can search for online 
courses  with  the  ‚ÄúProgramming  &  Development‚Äù 
section.  There  are  courses  on  Python,  JavaScript, 
Java, C++, Swift, Xcode, Kotlin, Android Basics and 
more.  You  can  also  use  the  search  bar  and  filter 
function  (program  type,  skill  level,  course  duration, 
skills). A small number of programming courses (one 
course  for  each  programming  language)  was  found 
on  this  platform,  so  we  did  not  consider  them  in  the 
overall analysis. 	
A  specific  feature  of  the  Udacity  platform  is  the 
display  of  reviews  of  the  online  course.  The  number 
of  reviews  ranges  from  105  to  3,114  depending  on 
the  programming  language.  If  the  course  has  not 
been  completed  by  users,  it  does  not  contain  any 
reviews (Table 6.).

Another  advantage  of  this  resource  is  the 
availability  of  a  syllabus  which  describes  the  course 
program  in  detail.  Such  information  is  greatly 
important  for  users  who  will  be  able  to  optimally 
plan their own learning process. Detailed information 
about  the  course  is  contained  in  a  file  together  with 
the  specification  of  terms,  number  of  classes,  course 
teachers, etc. 
The  summarized  data  on  the  number  of  online 
programming  courses  on  different  platforms  which 
can be found with the help of rubricators is shown in

According  to  Table  7.,  you  can  find  6,979  online 
courses  with  the  help  of  rubricators  on  four 
platforms.  Most  courses  are  presented  on  the  Udemy 
online platform (6,759 online courses, 96.8%). 
On  all  the  considered  platforms  there  are  online 
courses  on  programming  languages  such  as  Java, 
Python,  C++.  Their  total  number  is  3,970  online 
courses which is 56.9% of the total number of online 
programming  courses.  The  leaders  in  popularity 
appeared  to  be  such  programming  languages  as 
Python  (2,449  courses,  35%  of  the  total  number  of 
online  programming  courses),  JavaScript  (1,163 
courses,  16,6%)  and  Java  (1,113  courses,  15.9%). 
The  least  popular  programming  languages  appeared 
to  be  Perl  (2  courses),  Kotlin  and  PHP  (1  course 
each).  Regarding  the  PHP  web-programming 
language,  the  obtained  data  require  additional 
analysis.  Besides,  some  programming  languages 
(Scala,  Scratch,  PyTorch,  Arduino)  could  not  be 
found with the help of the rubricator. 
 
 	
Based on the analysis of the total number of online 
courses  for  each  programming  language  which  are 
displayed  in  the  thematic  sections  we  can  talk  about 
the  popularity  of  the  programming  language  on 
different MOOC (Figure 1.).

The  analysis  of  Table  8.  revealed  a  much  larger 
number  (98,506)  of  online  programming  courses 
compared to the number of online courses found with 
the help of the rubricator (see Table 7.). 
On  all  the  considered  platforms  there  are  online 
courses  on  the  following  programming  languages: 
Java,  JavaScript,  Python,  Swift,  Ruby.  Their  total 
number is 36,440 online courses which is 37% of the 
total  number  of  online  programming  courses.  The 
most  popular  languages  found  with  keyword  search 
appeared  to  be  Java  (12,031  courses,  12.2%  of  the 	
total  number  of  courses),  Python  (11,100  courses, 
11.2%) and JavaScript (10,324 courses, 10.4%). 
 
5. Discussion 
 
A  large  number  of  online  programming  courses 
presented  on  various  MOOC  platforms  will  improve 
the  skills  of  not  only  a  beginner,  but  also  an 
experienced  programmer.  Criteria  for  selecting  an 
online  programming  course  can  be:  popularity  of  the 
programming  language,  previous  work  experience,

requirements  of  the  software  customer,  teacher‚Äôs 
instructions.  When  choosing  the  first  programming 
language  to  study,  you  should  consider  the 
compatibility  of  syntax  with  popular  programming 
languages, the clarity of program code, free compiler 
or  IDE  [6],  availability  of  free  sources  providing 
reference information (guides, forums, etc.). 
Each online programming course requires a certain 
level  of  training  (understanding  the  principles  of 
algorithms,  ICT  skills,  at  least  a  minimum  level  of 
English).  Out  of  doubt,  the  initial  skills  of  working 
with  IT  and  programming  languages  are  formed  at 
school.  The  basic  course  of  programming  will  allow 
students  to  form  mathematical  and  digital 
competence  [3],  they  will  show  them  the 
attractiveness  of  being  an  IT  specialist,  and  they  will 
prepare  them  for  using  ICT  in  a  more  active  way.  At 
the  same  time,  students  who  have  demonstrated  high 
abilities  for  programming  could  consider  the  future 
career well in advance [8]. 
In  our  study,  we  used  two  ways  to  find  online 
programming  courses.  The  first  method  involved  the 
analysis  of  online  courses  by  thematic  sections.  In 
this  case,  the  exact  number  of  courses  related  to  a 
specific  programming  language  was  found.  The 
second  method  meant  using  automatic  keyword 
search  of  online  courses.  Programming  languages 
were  used  as  keywords.  This  method  allowed  us  to 
get  a  much  larger  number  of  courses.  However,  the 
disadvantage  of  this  method  is  that  programming 
courses  are  not  always  included  in  the  sample.  It 
could  include  courses  on  office  programs,  public 
speaking,  English,  etc.  We  witnessed  this  situation 
with  such  programming  languages  whose  names 
consist of 1-2 letters (C, R, Go, etc.). In this case, the 
user will have to browse the names of online courses 
and choose the right one. 
Regarding  the  organization  of  the  educational 
process  at  university,  it  is  recommended  to  combine 
the  capabilities  of  the  MOOC  and  traditional 
learning.  The  effectiveness  of  such  a  combination  is 
mentioned  in  [11],  [12],  [22].  In  the  conditions  of 
blended  learning,  students  have  the  opportunity  to 
communicate  with  the  teacher,  use  printed  and 
electronic  sources  of  information,  increase  cognitive 
interest,  as  well  as  to  optimize  the  amount  of 
educational  material  and  time  for  its  study.  All  this, 
in turn, will provide simultaneous training of students 
with  different  levels  of  training  [7]  and  will 
positively  affect  their  academic  success  [21]. 
Additionally,  to  provide  feedback  between  the 
teacher  and  students,  you  can  use  software  solutions 
that  allow  you  to  check  and  compile  the  program 
code  [10],  provide  recommendations  in  natural 
language  in  real  time  using conversational  agents  [9] 
or bots [23]. It  should  be  noted  that  the  content  of  training 
provided  for  future  software  engineers  in  the 
educational  institution  should  be  periodically 
improved.  First  of  all,  it  concerns  the  revision  of 
educational programs and curricula [5] in accordance 
with  the  technological  development  of  society, 
popularity  of  programming  languages  [6],  industry 
demands and requirements for future professionals in 
the  labor  market  [13].  Similarly,  working 
programmers  also  need  to  improve  their 
programming  and  teamwork  skills  [1].  Hence,  it  will 
have  a  positive  effect  on  the  demand  for  the 
specialists and their salary. 	
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Thus,  mastering  programming  skills  and 
improving  knowledge  of  IT  is  one  of  the  key 
competencies  of  modern  man.  Training  of  future  IT 
specialists,  in  particular  software  engineers,  involves 
the  acquisition  of  theoretical  knowledge,  formation 
of professional competencies, practical  orientation of 
educational  activities.  Such  training  has  specific 
features  related  to  the  need  to  develop  algorithmic 
thinking,  to  master  various  information  technologies 
and  tool  environments,  to  know  the  syntax  of 
programming  languages  and  the  rules  of  writing  a 
program code. 
Online  education  remains  an  effective  means  of 
acquiring  knowledge  and  developing  competencies 
in  a  distant  way.  It  can  be  applied  to  all  users  who 
have access to the Internet and desire to learn. One of 
the effective means of online education is the MOOC 
which provides access to a large array of information 
on various topics. 
Quantitative  analysis  of  online  programming 
courses presented on such online platforms as Alison, 
Udemy,  Edx,  Coursera,  Codecademy  allowed  us  to 
identify  the  most  useful  MOOC  for  programmers.  A 
comparison of the quantitative indicators which were 
obtained  with  the  two  methods  used  to  search  for 
online  courses  revealed  significant  differences  in  the 
number  of  online  programming  courses  that  were 
found.  We  found  6,979  online  programming  courses 
in  the  thematic  sections  (rubricators)  of  the 
considered  online  platforms.  At  the  same  time,  we 
managed  to  find  98,506  online  courses  using 
automatic keyword search of online courses. 
Online  courses  on  21  programming  languages 
were  analyzed  on  different  platforms.  The  maximum 
number  of  programming  courses  is  presented  on  the 
Udemy online platform (6,759 online courses, 96.8% 
of the total number of online courses displayed in the 
rubricators).  The  Udacity  online  platform  has  the 
fewest  number  of  programming  courses  (8  courses). 
It  was  analyzed  to  demonstrate  its  key  features.  In

particular,  it  concerns  the  availability  of  syllabuses 
and reviews of each online programming course. 
The  analysis  of  the  total  number  of  online  courses 
on  all  platforms  revealed  that  the  largest  number  of 
courses  in  the  rubricators  are  presented  by  such 
programming  languages  as  Python  (2,449  courses, 
35%  of  the  total  number  of  online  programming 
courses),  JavaScript  (1,163  courses,  16.6%)  and  Java 
(1,113  courses,  15.9%).  If  you  use  automatic  search 
of  online  courses,  you  see  that  the  largest  number  of 
online  courses  are  devoted  to  such  programming 
languages as Java (12,031 courses, 12.2% of the total 
number  of  courses),  Python  (11,100  courses,  11.2%) 
and JavaScript (10,324 courses, 10, 4%).¬†
In  the  future,  it  is  planned  to  analyze  the 
capabilities  of  the  MOOC  for  software  engineers‚Äô 
training  in  various  fields  (development  of  desktop 
and mobile applications, web-programming, etc.).

Latest CV:https://www.pymblesoftware.com/cv.pdf Latest CV:https://www.pymblesoftware.com/cv.pdfHumm Group white labels credit cards and provides nancial services such as small to medium-enterprise equipment leas-
ing. Specically, Humm provides consumer credit cards / Store cards such as the Farmers 28
chain in New Zealand and the
QANTAS Pay card.
Since I have had experience with nancial services and credit card processing online in one form or another since work-
ing with Plink libraries at BDE in 1997; I was able to quickly adapt to the workows, codebases/business practices of the
credit card services provided by Humm Group to provide bug xes and minor maintenance on 192342 lines of Swift, 879 lines
of Ob jective C, 334037 lines of Kotlin, 47,982 lines of java, excluding libraries. To develop the changes to these codebases I
reviewed Figma diagrams and incorporated changes to UI elements in Android and iOS code as per the requirements of the
JIRA tickets.
To modernise the build environment, I added Azure DevOps / Fastlane CI/CD build pipelines for a few of the apps. 28

Added f
	eature of Braintree payments integration in Swift and Kotlin in an app for NSW Government including
Apple Pay and Google Pay.
The previous payment integrationhad reportedly been problematic and the payment gateway vendor for
Braintree was almost eortless.
It took less eort and resources than expected so I added the featuresof Apple Watch and Android Gear
Watch integration into the app for the NSW government.
Did a custom notication where the countdown timer and buttons appear in the phone notications even on
the lock screen. Payments
The app communicates with an internal server, which acts as a proxy for another server that manages parking
meters.
Part of the credit card processing integration occurred on the parking meter servers and part was within the
app.
The idea of the app is to pay for parking meters from the phone and be notied of the need to
top up the parking meter if it is about to expire by tapping on the watch and the phone notica-
tions.
Complex integration due to the number of servers involved and the number of moving parts and the level of
security.

Title: IOS and Android developer.
Technologies: Swift / Kotlin
Maintenance work and small pro jects involving C#, Swift, Java, and Kotlin (Mostly Java on the Android side of things).
Fixed about a dozen bugs each week on Android then about a dozen on iOS the next week. The code was breathtakingly
bad, if the server found no results in the database it would return 404 instead of 200 and an indication of an empty dataset
in the JSON payload.
The server would 500 or 400 frequently on requests that worked a minute ago.
Somehow previous developers had considered the foreground and background of the app to be handled in view controllers
instead of the app delegate, there was a lot of surreal code.
Whoever wrote it had no idea of the application life cycle or standard industry practices like not abusing HTTP error codes.
I was doing work on iOS, Android and ASP.NET and completing featuresin two weeks they had waited 2 years to be

Short-term work on Bluetooth tile beacons for nding car keys - type tag beacons. Another USB-based Bluetooth beacon

OneAp
Sensoro beacons, translating Chinese comments into English.
Implemented feature ofAndroid circular
reveal animation like the iOS animation. completed button handlers, dierentiated between my wi and guest
wi buttons and called dierent web service endpoints accordingly. Scale and slide up login animation to
match the iOS version. Made UI consistent with the iOS version. Added disconnect handset screen in Kotlin.
Added feature of pull to refresh the menu on the Android version to be consistent with the iOS version.
Added site features refresh endpoint call and UI update. Added background handset polling. Used to be
location dependent. Fixed refresh, device count wrong and other bugs in. both iOS and Android versions.
A branch was created in the source code control system called allow_handset_choice to allow the choice of
a beacon/handset other than the nearest found beacon. An extra button was added to the found handset
screen. Touching this button launches another screen with a list of handsets detected. On both the iOS and
Android versions all the beacons that were available in the area are stored in collections in the bowels of the
Bluetooth code. In both versions, the collections were propagated up through the software layers until they
are presented in a UITableView or a recycler view and the on-item selection handlers then put the selected
MAC address in place of the nearest found beacon MAC address and then call the occupy handset code which
calls the web service endpoint (Function 16).
Half of the endpoints of the ServCorp server were in CodeIgniter and half were in Larvel in another repository. I set up a
local copy of the code bases on my development machine for debugging server-side and client-side issues.

Comments: Porting/remediation pro ject replacing SII middleware with Tuxedo.
Boris remediation pro ject. It is a 3-tier client/server application. Apple Mac client in OOPL communicates via OpenUI to
the COGS middleware. The COGS talks (via SII replaced by Tuxedo) to the Boris server which contains Pro*C code to talk
to the Oracle (7.3.4 replaced by 9.2) RDBMS. The SII section I was responsible for was the SIDL which is like the CORBA
45 IDL and is kept in a repository which is like the Windows registry. I wrote code to load SIDL to emulate the repository.
The original target platform was HP and later moved to AIX. I did a partial port to Linux to do work on my laptop.
Testing of the interface to another system that communicates via ORACLE database pipes. Took a reworked C# client that
communicated via OpenUI to the SII Boris and got it to call the Tuxedo Boris from the last two contracts. Led a team of

Comments: Maintenance work . This was a telecommu-
nication company that mostly built digital switches (Sig-
nal Control Processors - SCPs). I scanned the bug list in
the GNATTS database, resolved the bugs and submitted
progress updates. One of the bugs in the systems was a
multithreaded construction/destruction bug which was re-
lated to multiple inheritance and the C++ diamond problem as can be inferred from the following code snippet and opposing
UML diagrams:-

Z Once the bug list was reduced, I migrated the code from the Or-

use more open-source software and not pay for commercial licenses. I
reran the unit tests for all relevant parts of the system and worked
with other team members to resolve any issues. I rewrote the log-
ging code which provided streams ( << and  >> operators were over-
loaded) and URL style logging methods (such as le:, socket:, etc
). We had internal seminars on SS7, Voice Over IP, etc. The
main customer was One.Tel which was a spectacular dot.bomb fail-

Title: C Programmer.

Title: C++ Programmer.
Comments: Train scheduling. I produced graphical reports in MFC/C++, (eg zig-zag graphs that show when trains are
scheduled to arrive/depart at points up and down the line). The environment was ORACLE Pro*C which was wrapped within
smart pointers which loaded an internal cache, pre-fetching and lazy-evaluating as required. The development environment
was initially extremely chaotic which I resolved to structure. I introduced, set up and maintained, QVCS as no source code
control system was used and QVCS (a free/cheap product) was used at SMA where I was working concurrently (together
from 6:30 am to 9 pm every day and sleeping through the weekends).

3D Studio Max.
Title: C++/3D Game Engine Programmer for Defence Pro ject.
Comments: This was originally a 6-month contract which was extended to 11 months to coincide with the completion of the
pro ject. This was an extremely challenging pro ject which required examining a real piece of equipment (EOSS) a system
much like a periscope on a submarine and developing a design to simulate it. A director head with DLTV and Thermal
imager sits about three-quarters the way up the mast of the Huon class mine hunters. On the bridge of the ship is a console
that was simulated. I had to put 3 video cards into one computer and get all the device drivers to work together. Then I had
to get hardware-accelerated Direct-3D to function on two video cards, and load textures and vertexes into each card, while
the other video card displayed a menu system, I wrote that mimicked the controls on the real bridge. Some video cards would
detect that they were not the primary display device and switch to software rendering. Other video cards would steal vertex
lists or not load textures. The thermal imager had White hot and Black Hot modes and therefore two sets of textures had
to be loaded for each ob ject and ipped between them in the scene as the controls were accessed. The daylight TV camera
had an intensity control on the touch-sensitive control panel and therefore I had to walk the vertex list on the video card
and adjust the lighting intensity of each vertex in the scene. The glow and dim eect was quite spectacular and was quite
cool to play with. Additional functionality included socket code to interact with an Instructors station (which someone else
wrote). There was also a Digi I/O board added to the machine which enabled digital/analogue conversion of signals. The
pro ject was completed 2 two weeks ahead of schedule and I spent some time proling and optimising it as much as possible.
The Navy was happy to sign o on the pro ject.
I tendered a pro ject to replace the MADS (disk packs) on the submarine pro ject. The small tender (roughly $100,000) was
successful but the pro ject ($100 million plus) was suspended indenitely (pending a Royal Commission). If the tender was
not revoked I would have had additional continuing contracts with SMA.
This was about the same time that I had the BeOS C++ Ray Tracer article published in Doctor Dobbs Journal. 53

Latest CV:https://www.pymblesoftware.com/cv.pdf Latest CV:https://www.pymblesoftware.com/cv.pdfComments: TowerTechnology develops document and image processing systems and workow solutions. I was responsi-
ble for maintaining the device driver code for the medium changers (large mag-optical disk libraries which contain crypts
for disks and several drives). I became an expert on the SCSI bus protocol. I wrote a class factory pattern-based diagnostic
tool. The class factory would generate ob jects of all medium changers that the company supported and dump all kinds of
diagnostic information.
I completed a device driver for Sun Solaris to access the medium changers via a pass-through SCSI device driver, debugged
multithreaded kernel panics on the Tru64 platform and debugged faults on the HP-UX, AIX, Solaris, Tru64, and Windows
NT drivers.
One of the faults included reworking some of the drivers when the disk capacity increased from 2.6Gb to 5Gb, 32-bit limits were
exceeded and block orientated seeks had to be replaced with ioctl()s on the devices. Some faults required some functionality
to be moved from the upper layer of the kernel to the lower-level drivers or vice versa

I wrote MFC/GUI code for custom controls like a rubbery range control (like 2 slider controls in the same control, which
stretched and contracted at limits), screw control with innite wrap-around looping behaviour. The entire GUI was based
on ray-traced images and was extremely slick. Amiga style intuition layer framework so that existing components would

Le changement global des environnements froids  Ma  premi√®re  exp√©rience  de  recherche  a  eu  pour  cadre  la  Norv√®ge  centrale  et  le  massif  des Rondane  (1989)  avec  une  th√©matique  centr√©e  les  dynamiques  p√©riglaciaires,  essentiellement l‚Äô√©boulisation.  Ensuite,  l‚Äôexp√©rience  √©cossaise  (1990)  a  eu  pour  probl√©matique  l‚Äôanalyse  des √©tagements  morphodynamiques  le  long  des  versants  de  cette  montagne  atlantique  europ√©enne. Fort  de  ces  deux  exp√©riences  de  terrain  en  g√©ographie  des  milieux  froids,  men√©es  sous  la direction de Dominique Sellier de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Nantes, j‚Äôai d√©but√© des recherches au Spitsberg en 1993 sous la direction de Marie-Fran√ßoise Andr√©. Elles allaient me permettre de soutenir une th√®se  de  doctorat  devant  l‚Äôuniversit√©  Blaise  Pascal  de  Clermont-Ferrand  en  1998  intitul√©e :  ¬´ Le ruissellement  au  Spitsberg.  L'impact  d'un  processus  azonal  sur  les  paysages  d'un  milieu  polaire  (presqu'√Æle  de Br√∏gger  79¬∞N) ¬ª. La  premi√®re  partie  de  cette  th√®se  est  de  la  climatologie  et  de  l‚Äôhydrolologie  √† travers  l‚Äôanalyse  du  bilan  hydrologique  de  la  presqu‚Äô√Æle  de  Br√∏gger.  Les  deuxi√®me  et  troisi√®me parties  d√©montrent  l‚Äôemprise  spatiale  de  cette  dynamique  hydrologique  √†  travers  des  bilans d‚Äô√©rosion. Cette th√®se d√©montre l‚Äôimportance du ruissellement dans les phases de r√©chauffement climatique  et  de  fonte  des  glaciers  et  du  perg√©lisol  dans  l‚Äô√©volution  des  paysages  des  milieux polaires. Ainsi  d√©buta  un  approfondissement  de  l‚Äôimpact  des  changements  climatiques  sur  les  milieux froids, des versants aux littoraux, et une approche holistique de la g√©omorphologie paraglaciaire, discipline  en  pleine  expansion  sur  le  plan  international.  Dans  ce  contexte,  j‚Äôai  poursuivi  mes recherches  sur  le  terrain  dans  le  cadre  d‚Äôun  programme  soutenu de  2002  √†  2004 par  l‚ÄôInstitut  

!7!Polaire Fran√ßais Paul-√âmile Victor (IPEV). J‚Äôai int√©gr√© des groupes de recherche dans le cadre de la Fondation Europ√©enne pour la Science (ESF), Sedimentary  source-to-sink-fluxes  in  cold  environments (SEDIFLUX),  qui  f√©d√®rent  des  scientifiques  int√©ress√©s  par  l‚Äôanalyse  des  milieux  froids  face  aux changements  climatiques.  Cette  exp√©rience  des  milieux  polaires  et  les  probl√©matiques scientifiques  d√©velopp√©es  depuis  le  d√©but  des  ann√©es  1990  m‚Äôont  valu  la  reconnaissance  de l‚ÄôInstitut  Universitaire  de  France  (IUF),  o√π  j‚Äôai  √©t√©  nomm√©  en  2009  pour  cinq  ann√©es, afin  de d√©velopper  un  programme  de  recherche  sur  l‚ÄôArctique  face  aux  changements  climatiques.  J'ai soutenu devant  l‚Äôuniversit√©  Blaise  Pascal  de  Clermont-Ferrand une  habilitation  √†  diriger  des recherches  le  8  octobre  2010  sur  la  g√©omorphologie  paraglaciaire,  th√©matique  sur  laquelle  je travaille  maintenant  depuis  de  nombreuses  ann√©es.  Depuis  2010,  je  travaille  √©galement  sur  les dynamiques  paraglaciaires  en  Islande  septentrionale  dans  la  r√©gion  du Skagafj√∂r√∞ur.  Je  co-dirige la  th√®se  de  Julien  Coquin  sur  la  d√©glaciation  de  la  r√©gion  littorale  de  ce  fjord  islandais. Dans  ce cadre  des  recherches  men√©es  dans  les  environnements  froids,  j'ai  √©t√© chercheur  invit√©  par l‚Äôinstitut polaire allemand (AWI) √† Potsdam d‚Äôavril √† juillet 2014.

Objectifs et int√©r√™ts scientifiques du programme L‚Äôobjectif  principal √©tait d‚Äô√©tudier  la  r√©ponse  des  versants  islandais  face  aux  changements climatiques  sur  le  temps  long de  la  d√©glaciation  holoc√®ne.  Le  cadre  spatial  correspond  au Skagafj√∂r√∞ur dans  la  partie  septentrionale  de  l‚ÄôIslande.  Dans  ce  secteur,  la  richesse  des  horizons de  t√©phras  assure  un  calage  chronologique  fin  sur  la  p√©riode  consid√©r√©e.  Le  secteur  d‚Äô√©tude  est effectivement  une  des  rares  zones  des  hautes  latitudes  √†  offrir  une  telle  chronologie  d‚Äôorigine volcanique, couvrant une p√©riode aussi longue.  Ce  programme  a  permis  de  dater  les  glissements  de  terrain  et  les  effondrements  gravitaires  en relation  avec  la  d√©glaciation  du  fjord  au  d√©but  de  l‚ÄôHoloc√®ne,  de  d√©montrer  le  r√¥le  de  la d√©glaciation (rebond glacio-isostatique) dans le d√©clenchement des glissements de terrain.

La  logique est  celle  du  ¬´ Source-to-Sink  fluxes ¬ª  en  partant  du  recul  des  glaciers  depuis  la  fin  du  Petit  √Çge glaciaire,  analys√©  comme  origine  des  flux  liquides,  l‚Äôabandon  des  s√©diments  glaciaires  lors  des retraits  des  glaciers,  leur  reprise  par  le  r√©seau  hydrographique,  la  progradation  des  littoraux meubles,  et  la  s√©dimentation off-shore.  Il  s‚Äôagit  donc  d‚Äôune  logique  de  flux  s√©dimentaires  dans  un continuum Terre-Mer avec ici uniquement des for√ßages naturels sans perturbation anthropique.     

!10! Les territoires de l‚Äôenvironnement sous l‚Äôangle des risques naturels  Ce  second  axe  de  mes  recherches  est  n√©  de  l‚Äôint√©r√™t port√©  par des  √©tudiants  parisiens  pour  les risques naturels lorsque j‚Äôy enseignais comme ma√Ætre de conf√©rences. Mes racines nantaises m‚Äôont donc sensibilis√©  d√®s  le  d√©but  des  ann√©es  2000  √†  la  probl√©matique  du  risque  inondation  dans  la vall√©e de la Loire. J‚Äôai donc d√©velopp√© dans un premier temps des recherches sur la m√©moire des crues puis,  dans  un  second  temps, une  √©valuation  de  la  vuln√©rabilit√©  des  biens  et  des  personnes face  aux  inondations.  Cette  approche  g√©ographique  sur  des  territoires  sensibles  r√©pondait  √†  une demande  sociale  et  me  permettait  d‚Äôapporter  aux  responsables  publics  des  informations  pr√©cises et scientifiques utiles √† la gestion des risques.  Cette  exp√©rience  lig√©rienne  est  aujourd‚Äôhui  utile  pour  l‚Äôanalyse  des  cons√©quences  de  la  temp√™te Xynthia  du  28  f√©vrier  2010  qui  a  touch√©  le  littoral  atlantique.  √âtant  directeur  du  laboratoire LETG-Nantes-G√©olittomer  (UMR  6554),  les  demandes  soci√©tales  d‚Äôexpertise  se  font  de  plus  en plus pressantes pour l‚Äôanalyse des territoires littoraux face √† ces submersions marines. Je travaille donc depuis cinq ans sur le risque de submersion marine et une grande partie de ma production scientifique de ces derni√®res ann√©es est consacr√©e √† cette th√©matique. Je co-dirige la th√®se d'Axel Creach sur ce sujet avec une coll√®gue √©conomiste de l'universit√© de Nantes. Depuis octobre 2013, je  co-dirige  la  th√®se  d'Elie  Chevillot-Miot  sur  la  r√©silience  des  territoires  littoraux  face  au  risque de  submersion  marine.  Depuis  octobre  2014,  je  co-dirige  la  th√®se  de  Marie  Coquet  sur  la perception  du  risque  de  submersion  marine  par  les  populations  des  littoraux  fran√ßais,  avec  une coll√®gue psychologue.  Implication dans des programmes de recherche   La  recherche  sur  ce  th√®me  a  d‚Äôabord  √©t√©  lanc√©e  dans  le  cadre  d‚Äôun  programme  de  recherche centr√© sur la vuln√©rabilit√© du Val nantais. Puis, cette th√©matique de la vuln√©rabilit√© a √©t√© au centre d‚Äôun  programme  ANR  sur  les  littoraux  fran√ßais  (VULSACO).  Les  r√©cents  √©v√©nements  de  la temp√™te Xynthia nous invitent √† transposer les th√©matiques, et le savoir faire m√©thodologique des fleuves au littoral dans des programmes locaux (universit√© de Nantes) et nationaux (Fondation de France, ANR).

Puis,  durant  toute  la  seconde  moiti√©  du  XXe si√®cle,  il  a  √©t√©  ass√©ch√© jusqu‚Äô√† devenir un bassin de production mara√Æcher. Aujourd‚Äôhui, cet espace am√©nag√© par et pour l‚Äôagriculture,  est  convoit√©  pour  l‚Äôurbanisation  du  fait  de  l‚Äôexpansion  de  l‚Äôaire  urbaine  nantaise. L‚Äôaccroissement  r√©cent  de  la  vuln√©rabilit√©  des  biens  et  des  personnes  dans  le  Val  nantais  met  en √©vidence les conflits d‚Äôint√©r√™ts entre les individus et la collectivit√©, entre le local et le national. Cet exemple  pose  concr√®tement  la  question  de  l‚Äôapplication  des  politiques  nationales  √†  l‚Äô√©chelle communale. Cette  recherche  s‚Äôinscrit  dans  le  cadre  de  la  r√©flexion,  men√©e  en  France  et  en  Europe  sur  la cindynique  en  g√©n√©ral  et  sur  les  inondations  en  particulier.  L‚Äô√©tude  minutieuse  √†  l‚Äô√©chelle  des deux  communes  principales  du  Val  nantais,  La  Chapelle-Basse-Mer  et  Saint-Julien-de-Concelles, permet  de  quantifier  l‚Äô√©volution  de  la  vuln√©rabilit√©  dans  cette  zone  inondable  depuis  la construction, au milieu du XIXe si√®cle, de la lev√©e qui le prot√®ge.

L‚Äôobjectif du projet VULSACO √©tait :  (1)  d‚Äôidentifier  et  d‚Äôestimer,  sur  les  c√¥tes  sableuses  basses,  les  indicateurs  de  la  vuln√©rabilit√© physique (√©rosion et submersion marine) √† court terme (temp√™te) et long terme (2030), (2) d‚Äôidentifier l‚Äôinfluence de l‚Äôoccupation humaine du littoral sur cette vuln√©rabilit√©.  Quatre  sites (Noirmoutier,  Truc  Vert, S√®te,  Dewulf) ont √©t√© √©tudi√©s,  constitu√©s  de  plages sableuses  lin√©aires  et  basses,  avec  des  environnements  hydrodynamiques  et  des  contextes  socio-√©conomiques  vari√©s.

Objectifs et int√©r√™ts scientifiques du programme Ce programme avait pour objectif de faire √©merger une approche pluridisciplinaire pour r√©soudre des  questions  scientifiques  propres  aux  dynamiques  littorales  et  maritimes  en  organisant  un colloque de lancement du 3 d√©cembre 2010 : La violence de la mer : l'impact de la temp√™te Xynthia sur le littoral atlantique.  Le  littoral  Atlantique  a  √©t√©  affect√©  par  la  temp√™te  Xynthia  le  28  f√©vrier  2010,  notamment  en Charente  maritime  et  en  Vend√©e,  mais  √©galement  en  Loire-Atlantique.  L'objectif  de  ce colloque pluridisciplinaire  √©tait d'apporter  un  regard  scientifique  sur  cet  √©v√©nement  m√©t√©o-marin  et  ses cons√©quences  en  mati√®re  d'am√©nagement  de  l'espace  littoral.  Les  historiens  ont  mis  en perspective  cet  √©v√©nement  de  2010  au  regard  de  l'am√©nagement  de  l'espace  littoral  depuis l'√©poque  m√©di√©vale  et  la  pold√©risation  des  marais  maritimes.  Les  g√©ographes  ont  apport√©  une vision  de  l'am√©nagement  post√©rieur  √†  la  seconde  guerre  mondiale  de  l'espace  littoral  dans  une logique  d'urbanisation  et  de  baln√©arisation  du  littoral,  du  choix  architectural  des  habitations  au regard des Plans de Pr√©vention des Risques d'inondation, de l'impact de l'al√©a m√©t√©o-marin (force des  vents,  coefficients  de  mar√©es,  d√©pression  barom√©trique, effet  de  site...).  Les  juristes  ont pr√©sent√© les aspects r√©glementaires de la loi littoral et des lois r√©gissant les zones inondables et les enjeux  fonciers.  Les  √©conomistes  ont  appr√©ci√©  les  impacts  financiers  sur  les  activit√©s  littorales.!Lors de ce colloque du 3 d√©cembre, des acteurs politiques et de la soci√©t√© civile √©taient pr√©sents.!Les actes de ce colloque ont fait l'objet de publications.

Objectifs et int√©r√™ts scientifiques du programme L‚Äôobjectif  principal  du  projet  est  de  cartographier  les  zones  de  submersions  marines  potentielles sur le littoral atlantique fran√ßais en prenant principalement la R√©gion des Pays de la Loire comme zone  d‚Äô√©tude  afin  de  d√©finir  les  enjeux.  Il  s‚Äôagit  d‚Äôint√©grer  dans  cette  cartographie  l‚Äô√©v√©nement r√©cent de la temp√™te Xynthia qui correspond aux plus hautes eaux connues (PHEC) √† ce jour et d‚Äôy int√©grer pour le futur un potentiel d‚Äô√©l√©vation du niveau marin en relation avec le changement climatique  en  cours.  Cette  cartographie  fine est facilit√©e  par  l‚Äôutilisation  des  donn√©es  Lidar r√©cemment  acquises  par  la  r√©gion. Les  zones  sensibles  de  danger  potentiel  une  fois  d√©limit√©es serviront de support √† la quantification des enjeux en terme d‚Äôoccupation du sol (habitat, activit√©s √©conomiques,  infrastructures,  espaces  de  nature‚Ä¶).  La  vuln√©rabilit√©  potentielle  sera  alors quantifi√©e.  Enfin  des  propositions  de  gestion  de  ces  espaces  seront  propos√©es  selon  plusieurs sc√©narios de danger potentiel. Les enjeux en terme d‚Äôam√©nagement du littoral sont fondamentaux pour le devenir de cette frange territoriale tr√®s attractive de la R√©gion des Pays de la Loire.

Objectifs et int√©r√™ts scientifiques du programme L‚Äôobjectif principal de ce programme est d‚Äôanalyser l‚Äô√©valuation du risque par des populations des littoraux  fran√ßais  sous  l‚Äôangle  d‚Äôune  approche  participative.  Ce projet  cherche  √†  montrer  en  quoi l‚Äô√©tude de l‚Äô√©valuation du risque de submersion marine par les individus permet √† ceux-l√† m√™mes d‚Äôentreprendre une d√©marche d‚Äô√©valuation de leur propre vuln√©rabilit√©. Nous faisons l‚Äôhypoth√®se de  l‚Äô√©mergence  d‚Äôune  plus  grande  acceptabilit√©  du  risque  par  les  populations  si  celles-l√†  m√™mes entreprennent  cette  d√©marche.  Ainsi,  nous  pensons  que  l‚Äôacceptabilit√©  du  risque  est  une composante essentielle dans l‚Äô√©valuation de la vuln√©rabilit√© humaine. L‚Äôoriginalit√© de ce projet est qu‚Äôil aborde ces notions au moyen d‚Äôune approche pluridisciplinaire (g√©ographie et psychologie).  Ce  travail  se  base  notamment  sur  l‚Äôanalyse  des  biais  d‚Äôoptimisme  spatial  et  temporel  qui interviennent  dans  l‚Äô√©valuation  du  risque  de  submersion  marine  par  les habitants  des  communes concern√©es  et  qui  entrainent  diff√©rents  degr√©s  d‚Äôacceptabilit√©.  Ainsi,  les  habitants  interrog√©s pourraient  faire  preuve  d‚Äôun  optimisme  spatial,  c‚Äôest-√†-dire  la  perception  que  les  choses  vont mieux  ici  qu‚Äôailleurs,  ou  d‚Äôun  pessimisme temporel,  l‚Äôid√©e  que  les  choses  vont  s‚Äôempirer  dans  le futur.  Cette  √©tude  s‚Äôappuiera  sur  des  territoires  littoraux  qui  n‚Äôont  pas  connu  les  m√™mes  √©pisodes  de submersion  marine  et  dont  il  est  suppos√©  que  l‚Äô√©valuation  et  l‚Äôacceptabilit√©  du  risque  par  les habitants  en  sera  diff√©rente.  Il  s‚Äôagira  notamment  de  comparer  les  zonages  repr√©sent√©s  dans  les documents  r√©glementaires  de  type  PPRL  et  les  zones  √†  risques  √©valu√©es  et  repr√©sent√©es  par  les habitants au moyen de la cartographie participative, coupl√©e √† des enqu√™tes par questionnaire afin  de  d√©gager  des  biais  qui  op√®rent  dans  l‚Äô√©valuation  du  risque  de  submersion  marine  par  les habitants et de l‚Äôacceptabilit√© qui en d√©coule.

!34! Activit√©s p√©dagogiques     Sur  le  plan  p√©dagogique,  j‚Äôai  une  longue  exp√©rience  de  l‚Äôenseignement  puisque  j‚Äôexerce  depuis l‚Äôobtention  de  l‚Äôagr√©gation  de  g√©ographie  en  1992. J‚Äôai  enseign√©  devant  des  publics  vari√©s : coll√©giens,  lyc√©ens,  militaires,  √©tudiants  √†  l‚Äôuniversit√©.  Je  me  suis  enrichi  par  une  mobilit√© g√©ographique avec des postes √† Nantes et √† Paris IV - Sorbonne, mais √©galement des exp√©riences √† Clermont-Ferrand. J‚Äôai essentiellement enseign√© la g√©ographie physique et plus particuli√®rement la  g√©omorphologie,  mais  aussi la  climatologie,  l‚Äôhydrologie, la  biog√©ographie et les  risques naturels.  La  dimension  globale  et  l‚Äôapproche  paysag√®re  a  toujours  √©t√©  une  priorit√©  dans  mes enseignements.  R√©pondant  √†  une  demande  des  √©tudiants  de  Paris  IV - Sorbonne que  j‚Äôavais  en TD,  j‚Äôai  coordonn√©  un  manuel  de  commentaires  de  paysages  publi√©  chez  Armand  Colin  leur permettant  de  s‚Äôexercer  √†  cette  m√©thodologie  de  base  en  g√©ographie.  Progressivement, l‚Äôenseignement des risques naturels a pris une place importante au fur et √† mesure de l‚Äô√©volution des  maquettes  p√©dagogiques.  J‚Äôai  guid√©  des  √©tudiants  dans  leurs  premiers  pas  en  recherche (master, doctorat). J‚Äôai eu √† diriger des √©tudiants sur des th√©matiques vari√©es mais essentiellement sur  les  deux  centres  d‚Äôint√©r√™ts  principaux  de  mes  recherches :  les  milieux  froids  et  les risque d‚Äôinondation et de  submersion  marine.  En  cela,  la  double  fonction  du  statut  de  ma√Ætre  de conf√©rences et de professeur des universit√©s trouve tout son sens, √† la fois dans l‚Äôenseignement et la recherche, o√π les deux aspects se nourrissent mutuellement.

undergraduate research opportunities in Interdisciplinary Software Engineering. REUSE trains students in all elements
of research. We specifically seek out students early in their undergraduate educations and those who do not have access
to traditional research at their home institutions.	
Since 2016, approximately 55% of the 198 students who have passed through the program identify as non-male,	
and approximately 20% as members of other under-represented minority groups in computing (groups overlap). Of
the students who have graduated, more than 60% are pursuing research as a career, either in a PhD program (the vast
majority) or other lab or research environment. (One way to understand these numbers is to consult the CRA Taulbee
survey, which as of 2018 indicated that women made up 22.3% of the CS PhD population, and members of other URM
groups, about 4%.)
Program analysis.	With Jonathan Aldrich and Rohan Padhye, I have designed an upper-division elective course in	
Program Analysis and written an associated set of course notes that we use as a textbook. The most recent version of
the course and its book are available at https://cmu-program-analysis.github.io/ .Claire Le Goues Curriculum Vitae July 10, 2023 Page 12 of16

My work
I am a software engineer: from user needs, I create reliable and scalable software solutions.I strive to fully understand the needs of my users to find the most effective solutions. I take care of the
interfaces and documentation of my applications to make them attractive and accessible.
I intervene on all aspects of the software: from the server infrastructure to the user experience. I create
platforms with technologies adapted to the problems and constraints of the projects.
I seek maximum quality and productivity. I implement tools to allow developers to focus on adding value to
products (continuous integration, static code analyses, debug tools, development aids, etc.).
If necessary, I support my team members‚Äô skills development using good development practices and group
